cuteman	cjhgqx6	1407241609	. is your income w2 1099 or capital gains . input capital invested which produced those capital gains were already taxed . if you started investing made a killing and never worked a salaried job again do you think you should pay 30-something percent on top of the 30-something percent you already paid when you first received it on a paycheck or a more reasonable 15 percent on top of the 30-something percent you paid when you first received it as w2 wages .
diablo_man	cn93q1k	1419919924	. oh that would have been sweet . i could use the cash though being associated with ted nugent would make me want to kill myself . love how the superior court of justice in ontario passing judgement on canadian laws is being considered as paid for by the nra . enjoy being ignorant .
diablo_man	cgy3ylp	1398091385	. no . the fbi does not define a mass shooting as 4 people shot stop making up complete bullshit . the fbi uses the same definition of mass shooting as every reasonable person . as in a mass murder committed with a gun mass murder being 4 or more people killed in a single event including every one with a few injuries is just to inflate the numbers as well as a blatant appeal to authority by pretending the fbi agrees with you .
diablo_man	cfmuws9	1393194268	. japan the country that kills themselves at such a high rate 21.7 per 100k that the usa s murder rate 4.7 would have to double and then be added to the usa s suicide rate 12 to even come close to japan s suicide rate by itself . yup they must be doing something right .
diablo_man	cj50kkm	1406076447	. i live in a country that restricts magazines to 5 rounds in most cases . aside from inherent loopholes that allow more capacity a 5 round 458 socom/50 beowulf mag will hold 14 or so 223 rounds for instance legally there are still millions of magazines in the country that can easily be modified to hold the normal 10-30 or more . i have several canada legal magazines that even people who have never held a gun before looked at for 10 seconds before figuring out how easy it would be to remove the limit . it would be the work of 5 minutes with a battery drill to have a pile of full sized mags up here . illegal but why would a shooter give a shit about that . guarantee that if canada which actually has legal ability to retroactively confiscate legally acquired property cant figure it out it will never ever be effective in the usa . mag limits are completely useless and based off of the honour system . even if there wasnt any ways around it most crimes are committed with low capacity handguns anyways and doing tactical reloads would allow a very deadly shooting even with small mags . like with columbine and virginia tech . regulating the size of a box with a spring in it is an exercise in futility .
diablo_man	clbwt7k	1413534333	. so what exactly are you trying to disagree with me on here . remember this part gt i dont think student id s are necessarily not worth being allowed for id although the ones at my schools up here are no good for id purposes outside of school . i also dont think there is massive vote fraud conspiracy to be stopped by new voter id laws .
diablo_man	chsmoyd	1401232257	. speaking of attacking strawmen did i ever say anything about requiring training or registration at the state level . no i didnt . stop with the strawmen . you asked for examples of unconstitutional state level laws/bans to which i gave examples of state bans on handguns and state bans on carrying a firearm . some of those have recently been struck down as unconstitutional by the courts . i didnt mention licensing or training at all . many states incorporate that i to their ccw laws . so anything left you wanted to dispute . heller doesnt allow states as much lee way as you think .

diablo_man	cgg2xs4	1396228856	. because spending 200 on the stamp and waiting 6 months for the paperwork to go through as you pass closer inspection is really a high priority for someone looking to conceal a sawed off for nefarious purposes . last time i checked hardware stores sell hacksaws for 5-10 bucks with no questions asked right over the counter .
diablo_man	cn9cqy4	1419953677	. this doesnt track them . and would be easy enough to do without a registry . just call in the police and report a theft make model serial as you would with any other item . then they write it down as stolen . and in both cases nothing further happens unless they find the gun itself physically later . cant just lojack em .
diablo_man	chr8813	1401079042	. i dont know about knives but arsons are pretty well known as extremely deadly ways to kill lots of people . way moreso than guns . indiscriminate mass murder wise arson is by far the worst with bombings being as bad or second . some examples of deadly arson attacks undoubtedly many more daegu metro fire . hartford circus fire . dupont plaza hotel arson .
diablo_man	cgmfhnx	1396894706	. you are making the incorrect assumption that anyone for guns is also a republican/conservative . in the usa a very large portion of democrats less than conservatives but still large own guns and/or are quite pro gun.especially on reddit chances are the vast majority of gun owners are otherwise pretty liberal minded .
diablo_man	ch01r6z	1398274198	. that is more of a function of the overly harsh laws regarding silencers . similarly you could say silencers arent a safety product at all in canada because they are outright banned . but in europe where they are much less regulated and often required or encouraged they are very much used as a safety device .
diablo_man	cg3tf1j	1394954508	. no one wants to ban cars . hence registration is not used in that way . on the other hand loads of politicians have spent a lot of time trying to ban certain guns and put in new stricter regulations on them . they arent at all comparable in that way . but if yes there was an anti car congress member that somehow pushed through a law banning v8 s and turbochargers you can bet a registry would be being used in the same way . but no one fears that with cars . there is ample history of it in both the usa and worldwide though with guns .
diablo_man	cn946oo	1419921164	. gt you claimed not only was it universally disliked but especially among the police . again no i didnt . please please show where i did . i said it was never shown conclusively to have had a positive effect on crime rates or for police purposes ie solving crimes preventing violence etc . some people held opposing views on this but there is no real evidence or facts to back up what the pro registry people are saying . if you could find some i am sure they would be glad to see it as it would have been helpful for them to have at some point over the last few years . gt the effectivity of gun registration however is not an opinion that is universally held even among police officers who are the <SPECIAL> most consistent users . david griffin a police expert produced by the applicant conceded as much under cross examination gt q so you would agree with me then that the value of the long-gun registry has been an issue of debate within the police community . gt a <SPECIAL> an issue <SPECIAL> been debated in the police community . gt likewise mark chalk an ontario provincial police officer and witness produced by the applicant testified that at most the registry was only one tool in an <SPECIAL> arsenal and not an indispensable one at that . he indicated that a proper investigating officer would still have to do a physical search to find all of a <SPECIAL> firearms and that a search could be done as well before as after the <SPECIAL> repeal . sgt . chalk therefore concluded that the registry neither helped nor hampered an investigation . gt this conclusion was reiterated by superintendent christopher wyatt of the ontario provincial police who deposed that a search of the relevant person is done in any case and is more reliable than any firearms registry . likewise inspector clifford <SPECIAL> of the major crimes unit calgary police testified that <SPECIAL> database is not a replacement for good police work . in fact i believe reliance on a database such as the firearms registry can lead to lazy <SPECIAL> gt this logic applies with equal force to intimate partner violence . as inspector <SPECIAL> put it <SPECIAL> believe good police work is the most important tool for solving violent crimes including domestic homicides the majority of which do not involve <SPECIAL> but if you want to claim guys like chris wyatt are pro gun zealots thats fine . i mean it would be 100 wrong and every gun owner in canada would laugh at you but you could . gt chief justice mclachlin explained in bedford at paras 75-76 that <SPECIAL> a sufficient causal connection is sensitive to the context of the particular case and insist on a real as opposed to a speculative <SPECIAL> this insistence on non-speculative evidence harks back to the earliest days of section 7 jurisprudence . dickson j . as he then was summarized the point in operation dismantle at para 29 gt a duty of the federal cabinet can not arise on the basis of speculation and hypothesis about possible effects of government action . such a duty only arises in my view where it can be said that a deprivation of life and security of the person could be proven to result from the impugned government act . gt the evidence in the record before me does not meet this standard . as counsel for the crown states in their factum to be successful the applicant <SPECIAL> demonstrate through credible and reliable evidence that the registry had positive measurable effects prior to april <SPECIAL> the applicant must also prove that the elimination of the registry will result in harm or an increased risk of <SPECIAL> gt this level of proof has eluded the applicant . the upshot of the evidence is that the <SPECIAL> effects especially the repeal of the registration requirement for non-restricted firearms are debatable at best . at most the act arguably makes police investigations more burdensome and even that is not a universally held view among the law enforcement and criminology experts . gt there is no reliable evidence that the act actually has or will increase the incidence of violence or death by firearms . referring to the act to remove the long gun registry in canada . not my words and last i checked the nra wasnt paying canadian courts to rule as they did . there is a lot more in that link were you to be interested in actually learning about it .
diablo_man	cle6k82	1413765426	. well as i mentioned i dont live in the states either just commenting from my perspective as a canadian gun owner . although i am marrying a girl from the states and have many friends down there so i do get to see their views on it too . also i have seen a lot of studies lately indicating that guns are used in self defense pretty frequently in the usa . the low ball ones from anti gun organizations still put the numbers over 100,000 times per year and the one pr . obama ordered done by the cdc indicated likely more around 300-500k . the vast majority of which do not involve a shot being taken . r/dgu is an interesting sub that tries to post all the ones that make the news . just worth keeping in mind the self defense aspect of it is not unreasonable . they do get used in that manner even here in canada from time to time .
diablo_man	cg2bczt	1394785290	. for reference for those not familiar the sks is extremely common in canada and used frequently as a deer hunting rifle as well as casual target shooting . its not exactly a merciless mass murder machine . the fact that california saw fit to both ban it and confiscate it is just strange .
diablo_man	ch8dhfp	1399098059	. except many of those countries did take a very large number of guns away from people . so not much of a slippery slope there . unless you think most people are concerned about i am pissed they want my gun so they can put me in fema camps . rather than the much more logical and common i am pissed that they want to take away this gun i legally purchased and enjoyed using in a lawful fashion . that sucks .
diablo_man	ci496pu	1402437198	. if you call banning hundreds of thousands of old rifles from being sold a minor hitch . sounds more like a gun ban to any reasonable person . also you know he did support the newest assault weapons ban which amounts to banning the most popular gun in the country along with many others . and the flawed background check bill which added a lot of unecessary bullshit beyond what was needed .
diablo_man	cghi154	1396376901	. no . as of 2007 they discontinued the issue of a box of ammunition to the former soldiers and required them to be handed back in . that has absolutely nothing to do with civilians or those same soldiers being able to purchase and keep ammo at home . this is a common but baseless misconception . swiss people can have as much ammo as they want for their guns including the military issue ones as they want in their home . the only thing that stopped is they are no longer issued ammo . all this is laid out in the wiki article you posted .
diablo_man	clccrkb	1413576900	. gt that is 100 what they are saying . no that isnt what i said . please show me where you are drawing that conclusion from . gt no they said that gun owners are more likely to vote the way they want to vote . i said absolutely nothing to that end . in fact i said the complete fucking opposite here i wouldnt say most gun owners vote the same way i do . party i voted for in canada last time would be run out of the usa for being dirty commies . gt then why are they pushing for this law . please you ignorant moron show me where i pushed for this law . let me spell it out for you as i did for your other idiot friend . gt diablo_man i dont believe there is massive voter fraud occurring i especially dont believe that it is rife in student populations . i dont believe voter id is needed to combat this already nonexistent problem . and if there is going to be id needed to vote which i already said i dont support then there is no reason a proper id shouldnt be allowed if it is valid identification student or not . ok . how many times do i really have to write that out for you . my sole point was that a gun permit is really good id and is in no way less legit than a student id which is implied by the title . it is in fact one of the best id s you could bring . using a gun permit as an example is not helping the argument any more than saying a passport is allowed why not student id . would be . now please go back through my posts and try to find the parts where i am pushing for this law or saying students cant vote . please it would be just terrific if you could do this instead of carrying on like a complete imbecile trying to argue with me long after i have said multiple times that i dont hold the position you think i do .
diablo_man	cfnlqdc	1393270157	. wow you sure read pretty deeply into one word i typed . i was still only talking about who does or doesnt benefit monetarily from the introduction of ubc s my use of the word only wasnt some treatise on how the ubc s would have no other effects whatsoever . that would be silly . once again i dont blindly oppose ubc s i only made one point on the subject and you are entirely determined to straw man attack your misguided notions of what i believe .
diablo_man	cn92om7	1419917329	. uhh the vast majority of them were well under 5000 . most there were in the 500-1000 dollar range with a few being less like the short barrel shotguns and the m14 and a couple higher end ones around 2500 like the xcr . similar price ranges as ar15 s for those . like the t97 and the vz58 are both around 900 su16 is 700 . which is not expensive for a rifle . sks for 150 svt40 for 250 and m14 s going for 550 these days was 450 a few years ago . pretty affordable . being registered or not has nearly nothing to do with how well regulated firearms are in canada and how it affects public safety . the licensing system is pretty well 100 responsible for any gains canada has made and even those havent been conclusive .
diablo_man	clbuek2	1413523677	. gt you are terrified of them voting against the people you want elected . given i lean left and was born and reside in a different country entirely i feel pretty confident that you are wrong here . but go ahead try and make up some more bullshit about how somehow student id s are anywhere near as valid of an id as a gun permit given what is required to get them . if you want to say a student id is good enough that is fine though by my experience they are much easier to get than any real valid id and nowhere i have gone has accepted student id as a form of id but there is really no point in comparing it to a chl which is probably one of the better forms of id in the country . unless you just want to stir up shit with morons who cant wait to make it about guns are good enough but not students . oh the humanity .
diablo_man	cjv6k3u	1408501335	. so is there any evidence whatsoever that concealed or open carry represents a threat or significant amount of deaths . if not why are these anti gun organizations going after it . you would think they would be focusing on the sort of stuff that actually does kill people such as illegal handguns in the hands of criminals instead of taking a stand against the scary but so far entirely harmless open carriers who are non felons carrying legal guns in a legal fashion . but i guess it is easier to put on a symbolic show than make any real difference .
diablo_man	cn94vo9	1419923190	. which claims . i havent seen you actually contest any thing i have said just whether or not the police agree with me or not . you were too busy claiming i was trying to speak for 100 of canadians and police officers to actually dispute anything i said . when i said it could be argued that the registry had a part in mayerthorpe which i doubt you are familiar with i was referring to how the police approached the guys house checked him up on the registry and he came up as not owning any firearms . he then killed them with a hk91 a prohibited weapon that was not registered in canada .
diablo_man	clbww8l	1413534802	. lets use basic english since i assume you can read it . i dont believe there is massive voter fraud occurring i especially dont believe that it is rife in student populations . i dont believe voter id is needed to combat this already nonexistent problem . and if there is going to be id needed to vote which i already said i dont support then there is no reason a proper id shouldnt be allowed if it is valid identification student or not . ok . how many times do i really have to write that out for you . my sole point was that a gun permit is really good id and is in no way less legit than a student id which is implied by the title . it is in fact one of the best id s you could bring . using a gun permit as an example is not helping the argument any more than saying a passport is allowed why not student id . would be .
diablo_man	cl6uf74	1413065634	. when was the last time politicians got themselves elected by promising to ban and confiscate cars . there is no fear of a car registry being used in that way but there absolutely is regarding guns as both current events and past history in both the usa and virtually every other country with gun control would attest .
diablo_man	clmx5z2	1414557098	. probably because in the mid 80s-early 90s some fairly sizeable federal gun laws and bans came through . back when the nra was just about target shooting hunting and safety etc there wasnt exactly any major political movement to ban/restrict guns . i would bet that the local motorcycle riding groups would get a lot more political if the city tried banning sportbikes for example .
diablo_man	ch7z0je	1399059233	. the point of that sub is to show both good and bad defensive uses of firearms and discuss them . no one pretends every use of a gun is justified or proportionate . i dont have a problem with the middle one you posted though . he used that pellet gun most of which cant be easily distinguished from a real handgun to threaten the other person with . they reasonably assumed they were in danger and reacted accordingly . there is a reason why committing a robbery with a fake/pellet gun is still considered robbery with a deadly weapon .
diablo_man	chr8r53	1401080778	. i love how you manage to shoehorn gun fetishist into almost every single post you make . often more than once per comment . right now im kinda getting that vibe of the rabidly anti gay republican politician who gets caught giving blowjobs in a truck stop washroom .
diablo_man	cfpx63g	1393485997	. you dont have to register vehicles unless they are being used on public roads . there are all sorts of cars motorcycles trucks offroad vehicles race vehicles and heavy machinery that are not registered do not require a license to buy or use and are under virtually no other regulations regarding capability of that vehicle . in that manner that is similar to how people generally need to be licensed to conceal carry a pistol in public .
diablo_man	cl7fk5w	1413133720	. gt gun deaths in the states ballpark at 32k per annum . 2/3rds of which are suicides not murders . got any non anecdotal evidence to say that concealed carriers are a risk . because if you take any given group of several million people you will find a few idiots . this doesnt mean they are a risk as a whole and the same technique can be used to malign any group you want . meanwhile stats from states like texas indicate that people with carry licenses commit a small fraction of the amount of violent crimes and murders per capita compared to the general population . the plural of anecdote is not data . and what makes that poster a gun nut for posting facts about the differences in application between firearms licensing and car licensing . because he disagrees with you . gt oh for christ s sake you are n't seriously going back to the car thing are you yes i am . probably because this entire conversation has been about gun and car licensing from several comments before yours . . just because you cant read is no need to insult me for carrying on the same conversation you jumped into . but if you want you can carry on in not actually answering my questions because by now if you had a good answer i am sure i would have heard it .

diablo_man	cg2b9sj	1394784729	. what exactly is the point of raising the cost of ammo . a murder even a mass murder uses next to no ammo.shooting a couple 9mm rounds at your ex wife isnt going to be prevented by those 9mm rounds costing even a ridiculous 15 times as much . oh no i used 8 dollars of ammo instead of 60 cents even a statistical outlier like a mass murder would only use a few boxes of ammo and given they are planning on committing suicide or being shot by a cop at the end of it i doubt a bit more money on ammo would really deter them . meanwhile target shooters both casual and competitive burn through hundreds of rounds in a single range trip . doubling the cost of ammo would have a huge negative effect on people who arent using guns for crime and a next to zero effect on criminals who arent exactly buying bulk ammo from cabelas anyways . most crime is over in 5 or less shots . most target shooters shoot hundreds or thousands of rounds a year even a month for some . its pretty easy to see who it affects . even a small amount would be a large burden on the law abiding and you would need to tax an absolutely insane amount to even possibly make a dent on criminal useage . at which point it would be cheaper and easier to make your own ammo and that would just join any other black market ammo sources for criminals largely entirely insulating them from the ammo taxes .
diablo_man	ch4cshk	1398712467	. that doesnt necessarily mean it will be or that it will be for a long time . many states have had unconstitutional bans on handguns carrying etc such as chicago and washington dc that managed to stay in place for 30 or so years . some people were born and died in that period others became greybeards by the time it was just recently revoked and still not entirely removed .
diablo_man	cn92kwg	1419917089	. the registry has nothing to do with buying a handgun in a parking lot . in fact that is frequently how guns in canada legally change hands in the case of almost all long guns without a registry . most people buying off websites or person to person for handguns actually just ship them canadapost to the guys front door . the registry has nothing to do with determining if someone can legally purchase guns in canada . it is the separate licensing system which governs all that . the registry is just a redundant piece of paper .
diablo_man	cfb1hlz	1391971527	. actually we do have what you are calling assault rifles in canada . semi auto ar15 s and all sorts of different guns in that style are readily available in canada . the actual full autos are ridiculously hard to own and purchase in the usa and are never used in crime seriously only 2 or 3 recorded criminal uses of a registered full auto since 1934 . even then there are a few thousand people in canada who are grandfathered to own full autos .
diablo_man	cizd89u	1405545094	. literally none of what you just said makes any sense . still doubt you are going to be busting down doors yourself to steal guns from people . better leave that to other guys with guns right . because doing shit like that is dangerous i would expect people to be killed if they tried that en masse even here in canada . i hope one day when you are in your 20s you come across some of your old reddit comments and think holy crap i sure was a moron back then . it will be a day of great personal growth .
diablo_man	clccw1m	1413577140	. gt no i dont think that . students should vote and any id that is actually useable as a form of id should be considered one . gt given that i dont want to prevent students voting nor do i think there is massive voter fraud that an id program could solve which i had already said is there any point in me answering any of your other questions based on that assumption . read that . read that as many times as it takes for it to sink in . i dont agree with this law and i think students should vote . given that i just said i dont hold the position you stubbornly think i do why would i bother answering your other questions about that position . although with your painfully awful reading comprehension i feel like i should make an exception . you probably shouldnt vote . or have children . at least try and find people who actually hold the position you are arguing against before word vomiting all over them like you are .
diablo_man	cn9495j	1419921353	. if you are interested in a potential solution that actually had wide support from gun owners the coburn proposal to open the nics background checks system for private sales would have brought private sales regulations a lot closer to what they are in canada . it was introduced shortly after sandy hook and would have actually passed if allowed to go to a vote .
diablo_man	cfpo7a2	1393463449	. if you watch the video of it at least one of them absolutely intends to kill her . because he brought a gun to a violent home invasion in the first place and most importantly picked it up and was moving back to enter the house with it in his hands after the mother had already shot at them . his intent was definitely to murder the mother .
diablo_man	cfnaita	1393236000	. universal background checks would actually mean more sales for gun makers . how did you not figure this out . considering you have to get a background check already to buy any new gun in the usa or any used gun at a dealer or across state lines or over the internet adding more background checks would only affect private sales making them harder to do . this would if anything mean more sales for gun stores and manufacturers as obviously neither of them make any more money when john sells his used gun to bill . they would make money if bill got a new gun instead or if they were forced to run their private sale through a ffl that would make money off the transfer . opposing universal background checks could not in anyway be described as shilling for gun makers as they only serve to gain financially from restricting private used firearm sales .
diablo_man	cfmv7cm	1393194932	. has japan ever not had gun control . or going back hundreds of years strict laws on weapons like swords . to pretend that whatever has caused japan to be so non violent can be retroactively applied to the usa is silly . any examples of countries that had a fair amount of guns and then implemented strict gun control and seen positive results . before you answer this does not include the countries that had low violence before the new controls and mostly stayed the same after as obviously the new laws wouldnt have been responsible for their low violence rate . nor does it really include ones that have seen some decreases afterwards that were just continuations of an already existing decline no drastic changes . and of the ones that are left how will you separate their improvement from the mirrored improvements seen in nearly every first world country over the past few decades including ones that had no changes in gun laws or in some cases reductions in gun control . after all it wouldnt mean much to say country x put in gun laws and has seen 20 reduction in homicide in the past 20 years when other countries that did no such thing saw similar or even higher reductions in violence . the usa being a good example as it s homicide rate has been about cut in half since the 90s despite mostly reducing gun laws . as an aside dont see why the suicide thing cant be relevant as you guys are always including the usa s suicides into your stats for gun violence to inflate the numbers .
diablo_man	cfe81xw	1392283938	. havent had any mass shootings in canada either in 24 years and the gun laws we have here are way laxer than australia s in just about every possible way . we have generally lax laws on a world wide scale and even compared to a few us states we have more permissive laws . zero school shootings in a long time just means no one has tried it in a while . there are still plenty of guns you could kill a buttload of people with in australia its not like people have tried to do school shootings but merely been thwarted by not having a cool enough gun . similarly i bet people in norway could have been saying similar things like no mass shootings here . silly americans with their guns up until 2011 .

diablo_man	cg3uxj7	1394963346	. gt and no one wants to ban guns . what s your point . are you trying to be serious here . there are countless politicians prominent ones pushing for bans on assault weapons etc etc and magazines all through the last few years . dianne feinstein the writer of the awb they tried pushing through is on record saying that if she had the votes she would ban and then confiscate every gun in america . certainly loads of people looking to ban all sorts of guns in the usa never mind all the countries that are held up as examples of gun control canada uk australia etc . loads of guns were banned and confiscated there . or are you focusing on all guns . like as in if they banned everything but a model of 22 and a double barrel shotgun they could get away with saying but we didnt ban guns you can still get those two . never mind the other millions you cant have anymore . so what guns have failed inspection and been banned because they are unsafe to use . we dont ban cars from the country just because they look fast or have a big engine . there is no equivalent there . there is no one in congress saying we need to ban cars with racing stripes and other street racing paraphanalia . these race vehicles have no place in our streets ban the v8s and turbos . but there is plenty saying exactly that for guns . and in some cases succeeding in banning whatever models of guns they can get away with and then confiscating in some areas . canadian government just recently decided to arbitrarily ban about 13 thousand rifles that had been legal in the country for over 10 years . grand total of 17 million dollars at least worth no compensation offered confiscation or face jailtime if caught with one . lot of people who legally bought 1-4 thousand dollar rifles who arent exactly happy about that . and understandably so .
diablo_man	cmayav7	1416777606	. far from the only arson that killed people . mass shootings are fairly rare too as are mass murders using arson . but there are many arsons with much higher death rates than shootings and many people die in smaller numbers per time due to them . also might as well use the right numbers . 20 thousand plus of your 30 thousand are actually suicides not an accidental or intentional act of killing someone else . suicide is a totally different discussion . one that cant really be blamed on guns in the usa considering that the usas suicide rate is in no way high quite normal actually . right along with canada the uk france austria etc and much lower than some gun less countries like south korea taiwan china and japan .
diablo_man	cg3ticb	1394954947	. if you can defeat it so easily then what is the point . try answering that part first . that law would be completely ineffective on common crime guns like revolvers and sawed off double barrels that dont leave shells behind . and semi autos aside from being able to catch all the stamped shells with the aforementioned fishnet can easily have the stamp removed by filing the firing pin in 10 seconds . beyond that they dont last very long a few trips to the range would wear it out enough to be useless . even the inventor of the technology admits this . and while you are at the range/gravel pit pick up a few spent shells off the ground that were stamped by someone elses gun and drop them at the crime scene . its almost impossible to not think of a way to defeat the law the only people it would catch would be ones dumb enough to leave overwhelming evidence/witnesses behind anyways . so what is the point .
diablo_man	cle0pvt	1413753176	. yup switzerland is definitely not the be all and end all of gun stuff but in some respects their laws are fairly lenient . mostly in terms of what guns are available especially with regard to full autos . you need a license for full autos yes but after that they are actually affordable and you arent restricted to 30 year old guns and designs . i dont know about lenient regarding silencers . going through the usa s nfa process for silencers is a long expensive process that i doubt is any easier than switzerlands . as you said their carry laws are more in line with the stricter states . a closer analogue to the usa s carry law in europe would be the czech republic . there it is much easier to concealed carry a pistol basically if you can own it you can carry it . regarding silencers again switzerland is not best off in europe . most european countries that i am aware of have far more lenient laws regarding silencers than the usa and switzerland . many like england they are basically an over the counter sale right there no additional paperwork wait times expense etc . in some using a silencer is practically expected the civilized thing to do . switzerland is a closer analogue to the states regarding outright numbers of people who have access to guns and prevalence of full autos semi autos and pistols . given the federal law on sbr s and full autos and individual states assault weapons bans magazine limits and bans on nfa items generally what you are allowed to own in switzerland can be said to be more lenient than the usa in general . swiss laws .

Danzaemon	ci20wck	1402208561	. i believe security expert bruce schneier observed that while early adoption of information technology gave freedom-loving folk an initial edge governments and bureaucracies are catching up quickly and surpassing decentralized power . no technology is inherently good or evil but but any technology can be used by anyone whether good or evil . looks like the good had a head start with it but the evil are extremely well funded and motivated .

Danzaemon	cjq8ce1	1408039284	. goddammit why does it have to be a brainless lying sack of shit like randy who says this . sometimes it seems as though every time the oligarchs want to marginalize an otherwise rationale idea they feed it to one of their pet idiots for a sound bite .
Danzaemon	cezhqxr	1390770097	. it s not a difficult question . 1 the kochs primary business is energy coal coke that sort of thing the dirtiest energy sources available . they oppose environment protection because their money depends on destroying the environment . 2 the kochs like most wealthy people and perhaps like most people in general are extremely short-sighted when it comes to economic principles . general prosperity is good for everyone and a better healthcare system is well demonstrated to lend itself to general prosperity . however the kochs see only that social programs will lead to a slightly lower percentage of profit from their enterprises even though this would probably be offset by general prosperity many times over . 3 the kochs possess a greed that most of us have never experienced and probably ca n't understand . if you re reading this chances are you make less than 200k/year . you and i think that we d probably be pretty happy if we had even 10 million so should n't the kochs with their billions be satisfied . answer no . making money becomes an end in itself like an addiction . they will do anything or say anything to keep hauling in amounts of money most of us ca n't even comprehend and that they themselves could never put to good use . good use is n't the point their mental illness is all that matters .

Danzaemon	ciwbk13	1405272349	. i want to say something snarky and predictable like for issa going crazy is a short trip but that s not really appropriate in this case . representative issa is n't insane he s just a highly motivated sociopath . i do n't know why he s so motivated someone who lacks both intellect and charisma has little chance of higher political office . perhaps his patron oligarchs are paying him more each time he draws attention to this campaign of distraction .
Danzaemon	cgpwr8h	1397235146	. it s a little deeper than spite i suspect . rather it s motivated by hatred for the poor . to american conservatives poverty is like a self-caused disease . maybe they think of it as a character flaw maybe some even believe it s caused by sin . but the final result is clear ridiculous amounts of money mean a person is good and should be further rewarded while poverty is evil and should be punished .

Danzaemon	cgb9xvn	1395726347	. i respectfully disagree . i do n't think snowden s leaks were just good for americans to know i think they were and are vital for americans to know . i think every american should be slapped in the face with this body of information at least once a day .

curien	cgsh5ng	1397513842	. gt steps that makes no sense . i m not sure who the person following the steps is for one . the first step who is donating . the second step implies the person following the steps is a judge since only judges hear cases but why would thomas donate money to his own wife . besides his wife did n't accepted donations . she was a lobbyist not a charity . you have basic information about your criticism incredibly wrong . are you sure you actually know what you re upset about . gt and do you see no ethical problems with his failure to report his wife s income from these organization on his federal disclosure forms in direct violation of the law . i believe he corrected that . it s a violation of law when you knowingly misrepresent yourself not when you make an honest mistake . gt ask yourself honestly what if one of the liberal justices did these same things with liberal organizations . would you say there was no problem . i m a liberal so yes . for example i have no problem with ginsburg hearing cases involving the aclu despite her ties to that organization nor did i have a problem with kagan ruling on the aca despite working for the white house .

curien	clp7nk5	1414769041	. gt a voter id card is not adequate id for voting that s the thing though why is n't it . it does n't merely establish that someone with a particular name can vote it establishes that the person with the registration card has the card assigned to that particular voter . you could just as easily argue that a driver s license does n't establish you can drive it just establishes you vaguely look like someone who can .
curien	ci017r5	1401994041	. gt urbanization and urban density are not the same thing . i m well aware but without knowing what your cutoffs are for density it s pretty meaningless . gt fbi data from the ucr tends to disagree with your assertions here . baloney . my assertions are derived from the ucr . gt the fact that you re using outliers from the top ten list i picked the four densest cities . the fact that those are outliers in the fbi ucr compared to other less-dense cities is the whole point . you ca n't argue that super-density is the cause of the us higher homicide rates when the us densest cities tend to have lower homicide than less-dense cities . eta not sure about the source of this graph but it shows a pretty scattered relationship between pop density and gun murders . .
curien	clac4wb	1413397769	. gt that s counter to how the courts have interpreted the constitution for 200 years . so what . you asked how things should be not how they are . gt states do this all the time and continue to be able to do so . within increasingly strict limits . gt the drug war the same-sex marriage ban the affordable care act all started out being state-wide initiatives that were popular and then enacted federally . so what . as i said sometimes that change is progressive sometimes it s regressive . gt it seems to me like you ve bought into the conservative talking point that our government is dysfunctional and the republicans are the only ones who can save us . absolutely not . i ve bought into the incredibly well-established fact that it is generally more difficult to effect change in larger contexts . if you want to argue with that be my guest but the data is against you .

curien	cfyxfnk	1394457312	. gt think about that . the religious right has succeeded in electing republicans who are willing to falsely take oaths of office to support protect and defend our constitution and then betray those oaths . by this argument politicians acting to subvert jim crow in the years before the brown v board ruling were also betraying their oaths of office . abolitionist politicians who worked to subvert the fugitive slave act in the wake of the dredd scott ruling were also betraying their oaths of office . it s a morally bankrupt argument .
curien	ckresv2	1411581500	. gt of course you understand i never claimed he was/was not on the list . you claimed that he has no facts and makes shit up . you are essentially asserting that he has not been told that he s on the watchlist . specifically hayes claimed that he was informed he was on the list after asking for a tsa supervisor the implication being that the supervisor informed him . snappa s criticism was slightly off the mark they should have said you have no idea if he s been told he s on the terror watch list . but that pedantic correction does n't change the central criticism that you re making shit up that you do n't actually know about .
curien	cg6sa10	1395261026	. gt once they give you the car they ca n't tell you what to do with it . right but that s not what s happening . hobby lobby wants to buy a different car or one with different features . the law says that the car has to have a cd player but hobby lobby has a religious opposition to optical media so they want to get cars without cd players . if the employee wants to listen to cds that s fine but they have to pay for a cd player on their own . krunk s argument is that because the car is part of their compensation an employee who wants a cd player ought to be able to force hobby lobby to buy cars with cd players . gt gt if it s an effective and legal procedure or medication it should be covered . gt actually it is and that is what this lawsuit is about . no it is n't and it s not . the law says that contraceptives have to be covered and the suit is about that not all effective and legal medical procedures and medication .

curien	cln7fz0	1414594703	. that s also up to the judge . the prosecutor has to disclose the evidence the defense can challenge and the judge makes a ruling on what evidence is permissible before the jury sees it . while the fop might use it rhetorically it s really a moot issue legally .

curien	cg4r7r1	1395067745	. yup . birth certificates can be fairly expensive and no you do n't necessarily get one for free . my daughter was born last year and we had to pay 20 to get her first birth certificate . my wife has a hospital-issued certificate from gt 30 years ago but no one will accept it as proof of identity these days because it does n't have the anti-forgery protections modern birth certs have .

curien	cg6qkai	1395257755	. none of those statements are inherently anti-vaccine . in particular gt there s a lot of people who have suffered severe consequences from overdoing these immunisations . the issue is complicated by the fact that guillain-barre can be triggered by all kinds of influenza . so how much was the vaccine to blame . the panel concluded that the evidence favored acceptance of a causal relationship between the 1976 swine flu vaccine and guillain-barre in adults . you are claiming that anyone who believes that some vaccines might have problems makes a person anti-vaccine . that s fucking ridiculous . it s also ridiculous to claim that a person who said that the polio and smallpox vaccines were blessings and fantastic is anti-vaccine . seriously stop grinding your axe for 5 minutes and actually think about that .
curien	cl2zmxs	1412703466	. i do n't think it needs to be it just makes his comments a little less weird . gt if it s appropriate for the husband to be recognized as the other parent in the situation you mentioned why should n't the wife be recognized as the other parent in the equivalent same-sex situation . i already addressed this because with a heterosexual couple assuming that the husband is the father is simply the best solution given reasonable privacy and practical limitations . but in the case of a homosexual couple it s not . there might not even be a husband . there s obviously and necessarily some third party involved . gt but in a lot of states it s perfectly possible for two people who are legally considered to be a same-sex couple to have biological children . there can not and does not exist any human with two biological fathers or two biological mothers . no state s laws recognize this scientific impossibility . state laws are generally concerned with legal parentage rather than biological parentage and i do n't see anything in the article saying that utah does n't or would n't allow two same-sex legal parents . gt the courts have generally rejected worries about legitimacy and biological children as irrational reasons to ban same-sex marriage . this is n't a marriage ban . gt especially since it would not fall under the federal definition of marriage why would n't it . the article points out that utah does n't actually refer to marriage at all in state law . yet despite that current utah spouses do qualify for federal benefits .
curien	clrobf0	1415023609	. i ve never had that particular error but atms often have horrible ui/ux . the buttons sometimes do n't line up with the listed options i ve often gotten receipts after explicitly answering that i do n't want a receipt i ve once or twice confused the cancel transaction with the backspace button etc .

curien	ck83w3h	1409761387	. party-list pr sucks because it does n't allow voters to differentiate between a party and a particularly good/bad candidate . the result is that politicians are no longer directly beholden to voters at all but to the party elite who assigns them to seats . pr is a reasonable yardstick to measure the fairness of elections in aggregate but it s a poor choice for an actual election system .
curien	cge3x18	1396013538	. gt you are saying that people should not be prohibited from giving large amounts of money to elected representatives who do things they like . while i do n't agree with that it s not really the issue . yes it is the issue . you can not ban candidates from receiving large amounts of money without also banning people from giving large amounts of money . you can not have your cake and eat it too . you want to institute a huge restriction of civil liberty in the name of social good . i understand your argument but you seem to want to just ignore the negative effects of your proposed changes and that is completely unjustifiable . i support large donations including corporate donations for the same reasons i support allowing the nazis to hold rallies and the wbc to protest . the benefit to society of banning these undesirable influences does not outweigh the damage done through governmental restriction of civil liberty . and before you bring it up saying that banning corporate speech should be fine because corporations are n't people makes as much sense as saying that banning political bumper stickers should be fine because cars are n't people . gt what i really object to is elected representatives doing things because they know they will receive large amounts of money in return for it . legal or not tacit or not that is the very definition of bribery . no it is n't . bribery is the offer of a gift for the purpose of influencing behavior . it is not the alteration of behavior for the purposes of enticing a gift . taking an action and then hoping for a gift later with no arrangement of quid pro quo is not bribery by definition .

curien	cjvgher	1408535987	. gt because the topic of the entire post was about an atheist opposing religion in a city . i did n't respond to the entire post i responded to a particular comment four levels deep that had veered in topic from the overall discussion . gt it s not about personal inconvenience it is about the company/government completely ignoring employees . i would feel uncomfortable because it is an implicit declaration that i do not fit in with the company culture . my point is that the only source of discomfort i would feel is knowing that the employer was violating the contract the actual fact that they shut down the cafeteria during ramadan is a minor personal inconvenience only . if the cafeteria were vegan because the owners morally opposed the killing of animals for food would you also feel uncomfortable . do n't you think it s a little silly to feel uncomfortable just because someone else has n't accommodated your beliefs . to a vegan eating vegan is the default position and providing a non-vegan menu is a special accommodation . to many jews eating kosher is the default position and providing a non-kosher menu is a special accommodation . to many muslims fasting on ramadan is the default position and providing a menu during the day in ramadan is a special accommodation . maybe you don't fit in with the company culture . so what . if the company culture is button-down business dress there are plenty of people who would n't feel comfortable with that culture . should companies not have dress codes .
curien	cgq0h15	1397243147	. gt i was just saying that i thought background check laws could be enforced in response to someone who thought that enforcement would n't be feasible not that they would necessarily be useful or worthwhile . yeah i understood that . someone said it would n't be enforceable you pointed out it would be . i m just moving on to the next question of how useful it would be . gt well then that sounds like a fairly significant drawback to background checks . it s unfortunate really . we want something that is fast effective and still protects privacy . i think this is one of those choose two situations .

curien	cgchsvb	1395853724	. i m not 100 focusing on the definition of bribery i m focusing on the severe negative connotation of the word . i think we all agree that donating money to a campaign generally does n't meet the legal definition of bribery and that s not the basis of my argument . but folks are call it bribery for a reason they want to convey the severe negative connotation that the word bribery carries . bribery is always wrong . both the receipt and offer of a bribe constitute immoral behavior regardless of the nature purpose or amount of the bribe . so i asked is providing money to help elect a politician whose policies i agree with always morally wrong . is it morally wrong to donate to elizabeth warren s campaign if i agree with her political stances . if your answer is no then you can not possibly say that the act of giving money simply to help elect a candidate you agree with is bribery .

curien	cja31mp	1406563036	. cable is heavily regulated so i m not sure what you mean . what i said was factual the fairness doctrine did not apply to cable networks so the fact that reagan did away with it is mostly irrelevant to the current situation . the best i can understand your meaning is that you want something similar to but not quite the fairness doctrine . which of course has nothing to do with reagan specifically .
curien	clp7nk5	1414769041	. gt a voter id card is not adequate id for voting that s the thing though why is n't it . it does n't merely establish that someone with a particular name can vote it establishes that the person with the registration card has the card assigned to that particular voter . you could just as easily argue that a driver s license does n't establish you can drive it just establishes you vaguely look like someone who can .

curien	ch05vbh	1398282223	. gt if you ask the individual to pay for the id and then require it for voting it s a poll tax and it s a violation of the 24th ammendment . every state that has a voter id law provides them for free . the catch of course is that the documentation required to get the free id e.g birth certificate is n't always free . on the other hand it can be argued that reasonable ancillary costs associated with voting are not unreasonable or unconstitutional . states are not required to provide free transportation to the polling place for example . i do n't really know where i stand on this issue frankly . though i think your final sentence is quite right .
curien	cl60ud5	1412974726	. gt the typical response is you need documents to get that id . that is only true if you have never had an id . everyone starts off never having had id before so that s not exactly a rare situation . also you re forgetting about people whose previous id is expired or lost .

ohgodwhatthe	cer8gzz	1389900171	. yeah which is why slavery does n't exist anywhere in the world right . oh wait human trafficking is still a very real thing . but you just ca n't seem to wrap your head around that you just gave an example of regulation as an example of deregulation the government via a court broke up a monopoly . trust-busting is as regulatory as it gets .
ohgodwhatthe	cg40ny4	1394987694	. you re right in that it is n't right to stereotype people in such a manner but i think the majority of self-identifying republicans are separate from the republican party . looking at the whole picture these people who vote republican are very obviously being used and manipulated . remember the tea party . it s stuff like that i m talking about here . while it ll be great and all if marijuana is legalized it s important to keep in mind that this effort at legalization is n't some manifestation of republicans staying true to some sort of noble set of ideals . they re justifying it with their nominal small government ideology but that s not why this meeting is happening . this is a very good example of the republican party being dragged along unwillingly into the 21st century .

PyreDruid	cil3qmy	1404159124	. gt as it stands the sc just made an exception to a law created by congress for one specific religion . now either this reasoning holds for all religions with any objection to any law or the sc just allowed the establishment of a preferred religion . how . you could oppose any mandate on religious grounds and it will be upheld unless there s a good reason to not allow the exception . this is n't choosing one religion at all . gt only applies to contraceptives . hmmm are we to believe that there are no medical reasons or risks addressed by various contraceptives most of which hobby lobby provide anyway . and narrow is fine . it s saying the government does n't have a compelling reason for these but they do for more serious issues . gt even worse not all religions have objection to contraceptives . what . that makes no sense . they did n't say no company can offer birth control . you want to offer it go ahead . no one is stopping you at all .
PyreDruid	cj8e9pt	1406390746	. depends on how they have it set up and how much storage they have how old the infrastructure is . what the government rates are on it etc . water fluctuates quite a lot in cost area to area . my guess is detroit does n't have access to enough water for it s residents so it s purchasing water from a neighbor . for example the county i m in 6ccf of water costs 67 for two months . in the neighboring city which has to buy the water from us it s 85 a month . because they just do n't have the ability to store capacity . so yeah . it s ridiculous charges in detroit . but it may just be due to the water system situation .
PyreDruid	cihmghq	1403795387	. and yet verizon has to pay for the ota channels too . so does comcast . because they transmit it from their centers not from your own home . they tried to sneak through a loophole and the loophole was closed . it s not a huge massive horrible loss .
PyreDruid	cilc2ez	1404176923	. sorry was n't being clear . the decision does n't mean that non christian businesses have to pay more . it was n't a decision on religion alone but on a specific belief . any non christian business with that belief that fits the criteria is fine to pay less too . it does n't help employees but that was n't the dealt with today . employees can try to make their employer carry it by protesting or striking or leaving for another place . the government just ca n't mandate it .
PyreDruid	cks9zmf	1411663194	. oh i agree they could really automate the dmv better and save the time for things that have to be done or for the people who wait too long to do it online i need plates today i can wait for them to be mailed kinda stuff making it better for everyone . just until then lining up like its an iphone is the best we can do .
PyreDruid	ci7d4zw	1402754552	. cutting back the costs would be ideal but painful . only real way to do it is to deny loans to places that do n't follow certain cost cutting measures . which might drive up the cost anyway . or encourage people to just get community college for 2 years . on the other hand . state schools get to deal with increased numbers of students and decreased funding from states in a lot of cases . so what do you want them to do about it .
PyreDruid	cjxl9tw	1408726606	. that s a pretty good explanation . i understand all the points i know he s still in contact and can handle what s going on even on vacation . i know he s not taking every other day off . yet the visual of him playing golf after americans were killed is horrible . the human reaction is that s terrible even though i know he s not any less aware of what s going on . this is n't a governance problem . it s a pr one .
PyreDruid	cfjdc1c	1392833026	. not going to say it does n't but why should n't people be allowed to have it on a plate . i d love to see it relegated to history where i am but it s not and we have it on a plate . i have n't seen any horrors cause by the license plate so i m content to leave it alone . i wo n't say it does n't color my opinion of people who get it though .
PyreDruid	clykwkl	1415643748	. there s some of that and i think to be fair some people annoyed that the president and the democrats have n't been hell bent on addressing inequality . and some of the issues in people s lives part time for example feels like a direct response to the issue he is going to the mat for .
PyreDruid	cihrgr5	1403805465	. it also has a lot of the rights to sports . as long as they re the only place to catch certain things people will pay for it . i do n't know a lot of people that d pay for it because they love it . but i know a lot who d pay for it so they could watch certain things .
PyreDruid	cimxj45	1404333231	. i m in the same place too honestly . i do n't like the idea of corporations with free reign to spend . but i like all of the solutions even less . too many unexplored unintended consequences . hell half of the problems we have now have arisen from our attempts to fix the problem .
PyreDruid	cihtecw	1403809043	. and what is the earnings amount for the broadcasters . they re saying they lose 7.6 billion in future revenues if they lose the retransmission fees . if they lose 7 billion in future earnings dropping over the air why would n't they . it s extremely unlikely but they were discussing it as an option depending on how much they lose . and yeah that s the least likely outcome . far more likely they just close the loophole in congress . none of it matters though . they did n't buy that they re not a cable company .
PyreDruid	cluu00u	1415294081	. well then the party that s losing because they re not voting might want to make sure that they start getting some things they want . people vote to put in people they think will improve their lives . if you do n't improve one groups life they stay home . and then it s supposed to be theyre stupid entitled brats . not at all . people assume they ll just turn out to vote and they do n't . some of that has to be on the politicians that do n't do enough to improve their lives . it s how the system is played .
PyreDruid	cka0dh5	1409935096	. so they hit rock bottom and improved . of course with a reasonable moderate central government they might have improved a lot more by now but i guess that s irrelevant too . it s analysis in a vacuum . how have it s stable similarly sized countries done .
PyreDruid	cfzbecf	1394488886	. and here i thought good ideas and leadership were what i should try to find in a president . i mean he might support some awful policies but dammit he s more macho . another reason a lot of people have n't been taking the right here seriously lately .
PyreDruid	cltwbvc	1415213842	. gt 2 voter showing sucks in these . then they deserve what they get . getting registered if you have to and voting in a primary is a good way to get candidates you want . especially if your vote is going to count more due to less people voting .
PyreDruid	cew3qo5	1390415343	. gt another angle to this problem is to have any lawmaker have a cooldown period . what i mean by that is that they ca n't work as a lobbyist for a set number of years . or maybe even they ca n't work for an industry they had to regulate . if a senator is on the banking committee guess what . you ca n't go to work for the banking industry for x number of years . the whole point of this is to not make a congressman flinch . if there needs to be a new regulation/law written it gets written . i think what you have now is law makers thinking about their career after office . gt gt gt gt just look at the fcc chair meridith baker . she passed regulations favoring comcast and now she s working for them . this i have no issue with . i suppose someone would argue they re losing rights by not being able to get the job they want after office but since running for office is a choice i d say they made that choice by running . i can really get behind this .
PyreDruid	cgqcjjp	1397273451	. in context it sounds like a dumb way to get across the point of whites and blacks may have different cultures but they re still people . it s clumsy it sounds dumb but it doesnt sound as bad in context as it does out of context . i mean the second half of that quote that they deleted gt it was the same and that s really what this society s all about now here in the u.s.a . there s no difference . there s no difference . there may be a cultural entertainment people may gravitate toward different cultural entertainment but you go down to little italy and you re gon na have that . it has nothing to do with the color of anybody s skin . that s pretty much the opposite point they were using it as .
PyreDruid	cf1jdeq	1390967716	. i do n't know . the whole slam on republicans is they have no ideas . she provided none . sure sounding condescending might not be the worst . but she only avoided saying anything horribly destructive because she did n't say anything . i wish she provided one or two well thought out ideas . not just personal stories prayers and platitudes .
PyreDruid	ciho8lo	1403799035	. from nytimes gt though aereo itself was a small service with fewer than 500,000 subscribers the broadcast networks worried that cable and satellite companies would adopt similar technology in an effort to avoid paying retransmission fees which according to snl kagan a media research firm total more than 4.3 billion annually . that s just where i m getting that from . maybe that amount does n't include over the air broadcast but i d wonder why they d be worried about losing the stream then .
PyreDruid	ceq3e1d	1389791025	. gt it s public financing . france does exactly what i call for except for allowing individual humans to donate . 1 in france corporations and businesses are n't allowed to buy elections and pac s do n't exist . most financing comes from the government who allocates money to those parties and candidates who meat some minimum threshold . i d just go one step further than france and make the maximum individual donation cap 0 instead of 5,980 . useless reform . you can remove 100 of donations and nothing changes . people just buy the ads themselves and convince people directly . yo can even ban corporate ads then the rich alone can get their message out . you ca n't in the us at at least stop people from giving their opinion . it d never hold up . donations to a candidate are only a tiny part of the issue . gt no it just bans speech that the rich buy by ending campaign donations . good . like i said . then they just buy airtime themselves and give their opinion . all you ve done is cut the non-rich out entirely . i could n't contribute to the process . those evil kochs could all day long . how is that an improvement . gt what we have now is capitalist dictatorship . ending the direct control of elections by moneyed interests would be a good thing if you believe democracy to be good . well . it s also a pipe dream that s illegal to implement until you change the basic rules . rules you ll never get changed . and you still are under the assumption that stopping donations makes it better . there s no evidence it would in the us . most ads you see are n't donations to a candidate . you think a candidate cares if they ran the ad or if mr moneybags ran the ad for them in the grand scheme of things .
PyreDruid	cifcxha	1403572129	. i ve yet to hear anyone explain how wolfpac solves the problem of the independently wealthy . if i m rich enough to run ads on my own with no corporation i could still run ads touting issues which the candidates could then latch onto with limited public funding . how does that do anything but give the rich even more power .
PyreDruid	cfjkdv3	1392846545	. gt the kkk using public property is a million miles from letting them have a state license plate . why . the plates are basically public property and they re opening them up to any group that can meet the requirements . i ca n't see a difference . gt so you cant think of a reason why the state shouldnt endorse a racist group on a state-sanctioned license plate . sure i can see reasons . i just do n't know if i see good legal ones while they let other groups in my state we have pro-choice plates pro-peace plates etc for example use the same process . just saying here you go do this get a plate we are n't getting more involved is pretty compelling as a good public practice . i mean if i was the sole arbiter id love to say hell no to them . but that s probably why there s laws .
PyreDruid	cimwfai	1404331086	. gt are people who carry less likely to speed or commit any other crimes too . doubt it . depending on the state it s not possible to legally carry if previously convicted of certain crimes . so on that grounds alone it s more likely they are n't committing crimes .
PyreDruid	ci0nfix	1402060750	. check out living conditions for the average north korean china is n't as great either . certainly are n't running concentration camps for people who say something bad about the government here . there s some corrupt people in power but it s nothing close . not by a long shot and it s disingenuous to say otherwise .
PyreDruid	cep3irj	1389678780	. absolutely you can it d be covered under gift does not mean 4 . anything of value provided by an individual on the basis of a personal friendship unless the officer or employee has reason to believe that under the circumstances the gift was provided because of the official position of the officer or employee and not because of the personal friendship . that section on what a gift does not mean allows for things that would be done as a basic part of living . so it really just applies to hey you work for the state here s 150 . which is the type of gift thats a problem . no one wants to stop you from buying a christmas present for your friend because they re your friend .

PyreDruid	cew3a0s	1390414368	. gt while publicly funded elections and preventing large dollar donations might not stop bad advertising practices i think that is not really the problem they are intending to solve . right now congresscritters spend a large amount of their time fundraising . when they are fundraising they are on the phone with the wealthy people who can make their campaigns work . when they are legislating they are thinking about fundraising and who they need to keep happy to keep those dollars flowing and keep their jobs . remove the need for fundraising and you remove the soft corruption caused by the need to keep the donors happy . removing that sort of corruption is the real point imo to make it so that our elected officials can focus on we the people instead of on the election funders . a situation also solved by term limits which does n't affect free speech .
PyreDruid	cep3a75	1389678075	. theres plenty of loopholes for that . you get 150 flower arrangement from your best friend because your mother died perfectly fine . mother in law gets you a 300 necklace for christmas should be fine as well . best friend pays for a ski day trip for you for your birthday no problem . at least that s how i m reading the orders section on non gifts further down .

PyreDruid	cew4o0z	1390417246	. gt it s a question that needs to be addressed separately . but it also is the reason that saying only op-ed would be allowed is useless . gt how about something that closes the loopholes . you still have n't responded to my other response about that . these things are doable i just did n't want to spend the time thinking up legislation . you d have to eliminate political speech from the 1st amendment protections . anything short of that is going to have real issues holding up . gt you act like it s impossible to restrict money in politics . they do it in many other advanced democracies . this is not rocket science there s just vested interests against doing so . you thought of some loopholes i responded to them . but i m not really interested in shooting down anything you can think of because that s for lawyers/legisllatures yes and yet looking at the way the courts view money as political speech it d have an uphill climb here in the us . i think british parliament is a better system of government and plenty of other countries have them and they work . hell the us sets up parliaments when we nation-build . but i do n't think it d work here .

PyreDruid	cm8xsh1	1416579220	. yeah . in my mind if every time i even talk to a cop might end up on youtube etc depending on how the law works around me this would seriously make me consider not having the cameras . yeah some police are bad but this is n't the only fix and the loss of privacy for most people outweighs the benefits in my mind .
PyreDruid	cifhmaq	1403583414	. that 3 billion in citizens money is spread out how . among every race in the country . can i spend my voucher on a key race in another state . do they cover local elections . what about states with off year state elections or is that 3 billion per race which is way too expensive . sure it sounds like a lot but when it s spread out among 460 national races a cycle plus countless local races and primaries and where key house elections have far far fewer voters and a lot less money a billionaire could really really make a difference . the koch s and soros s of the world can focus across boundaries into far more sway-able elections while most of that 3 billion is tied up in running ads for people that have no shot based on the electorate . a few extra hundred thousand dollars is n't toppling pelosi in her general election for example . but a couple million in a right senate race in wyoming could swing the balance of power .
PyreDruid	cikuwp5	1404141197	. how does it say that . seems to me it says the government can override a religious belief if it has a compelling interest . one it would for discrimination or in the instance a company wants to ban life saving treatments like transfusions but they it does n't have a compelling interest in this case . that s a whole lot narrower .
PyreDruid	ci4tytm	1402499941	. that 200k is a bit misleading he had some free press on national shows like beck to reach his base and turned out quite a few tea party celebrities for his cause . it s not a lot of money sure but he also had allies working cheap just to take out cantor and salvage the primary season .
PyreDruid	ci4vapk	1402502788	. this is n't a 50/50 district . the point of voting in primaries where i live is to pick the republican you like most so that when they get elected you re better with the choice than the alternative . do n't forget until very recently the democrats were n't even going to contest the general election in the 7th . and i do n't ever see opposition in my local elections . this is a 60 republican district . it d take a lot to unseat them .
PyreDruid	cikyedo	1404148587	. my understanding is the left might not have voted for the mandate as well have heard a few pundits mention that and this is so narrow of a win it hardly bans plan b . if this was the republicans plan all along it s a weak plan .

waylaidbyjackassery	cf5yk57	1391443481	. oh so the actions of a minority of gun owners mean the majority of gun owners should n't have it s right s infringed . then why ca n't people own automatic weapons without a special license . because the amount of death they can deal in the wrong hands outweigh the need for personal defense . so basically gun nuts are just quibbling about the numbers of dead children this nation has to endure to keep easy access to firearms . there were about 127 children dead from gun violence last year and gun nuts think it would be ok if there were more . i would like less dead children due to irresponsible gun owners . mental exams and proof of necessity are n't infringing on your 2nd amendment rights . they re protecting my right to life .
waylaidbyjackassery	cfeikve	1392317876	. yeah it s not like new orleans has a history of corrupt politicians or anything . and if you re gon na talk corruption . crew has published seven annual reports since 2005 of the politicians that crew identifies as the most corrupt members of congress . the 2005 report included 11 republicans and 2 democrats 7 the 2006 report included 17 republicans and 3 democrats 8 the 2007 report included 18 republicans and 4 democrats 9 the 2008 report included 17 republicans and 7 democrats 10 the 2009 report included 7 republicans and 8 democrats 11 the 2010 report included 16 republicans and 10 democrats 12 the 2011 report included 10 republicans and 4 democrats . 13 the 2012 report included 13 republicans and 7 democrats . 14 the 2012 election cycle saw 11 of the 32 lawmakers included in the last two reports either defeated or retiring . 15 .
waylaidbyjackassery	cejsdoz	1389124547	. funny how that works is n't it . but there is a bright spot . you can use this same trick to tell people who bust on unions that there s nothing in any agreement any union ever got that was n't agreed to by management so it s really all management s fault .
waylaidbyjackassery	ceixsjw	1389040498	. none of which refuted anything i said . come back when you have some numbers and not a fucking op ed . you do know that an opinion piece is just that right . someone s opinion and not substantiated in any way on any of it s contentions . until then it s just spew . i think the real problem guys like you have with entitlements is someone who s life is demonstrably worse than you getting something that you do n't and that just pisses you off huh . want to fix the ss problem . eliminate the limit on taxation of ss . there . fixed forever . want to fix the medicare entitlements . go to single payer like every other civilized nation on the planet and pay half what we do now . the problem is n't the entitlements . it s that the rich have taken and taken and taken and when asked to give back just give the country a stiff middle finger .

waylaidbyjackassery	cevyux5	1390404366	. well since most of these gop asshats think taxation is theft stealing from thieves is n't that big a deal . only taxation is n't theft . thinking it is betrays a fundamental lack of understanding of how our society and system of government works . the amount of revenue lost to outright tax fraud could more than pay for the entire medicare program . but making sure that paris hilton does n't have to pay the same high tax rate for blowing eurotrash and doing coke as some nurse who shows up for work for 40 years day in and day out is what the gop lives for .
waylaidbyjackassery	cf013km	1390831081	. so you say my example is shit then admit my criticism is valid . citing republican charitable giving is n't proof that they are more generous . only a dolt would claim that . let me know when republican policies result in more money in workers pockets or come close to fulfilling the needs of our society like social security does amp has for over 80 years . and of course you could cite other motivations for charitable giving other than altruism but that would require a shred of intellectual honesty huh . and if as you suggest wealth is created why has ceo amp executive compensation skyrocketed relative to stagnant worker pay . seems like someone is n't sharing huh . you are a classic republican short on actual facts but long on faulty premesis .

itsthenewdan	chorr3q	1400796703	. gt this much money in our elections is outta fucking control . on this you are absolutely correct . however and i hope we can all agree on this the political spending of the koch brothers is particularly destructive to the general interests of the population . this is because of what they support not merely the fact that they re spending money . now the next thing that i hope we can agree on is the reality of a post citizens-united world . which is to say that the kochs are indeed spending lots of money to further their bad for almost everyone agenda . now since we live in reality and not a fantasy world choose which of these is the best outcome in the short term 1 . the koch brothers spend lots of money on their agenda and nobody spends a comparable amount of money to oppose that agenda . 2 . the koch brothers spend lots of money on their agenda and tom steyer spends a comparable amount of money to oppose that agenda . 3 . nobody spends lots of money on their agenda . this is n't a valid choice . the kochs are definitely spending lots of money on their agenda . unless you are a koch brother or one of their obscenely wealthy buddies i think choice 2 is obviously the best of what s currently available . anyone who wants to get the money out of politics should join me in supporting rootstrikers wolfpac and maydaypac . but until then yes a balancing force of expenditure to fight the koch agenda is a better thing than the initial expenditure of the kochs .
itsthenewdan	cj0bn4h	1405631355	. ok let s go through that example with california-ish numbers . start at green 5 democrat 55 republican 35 libertarian 5 alternative parties grab more voters green 20 democrat 40 republican 20 libertarian 20 . in this precise case democrats dominate and do n't need to budge but if they did they would still move to the right because there s a 40 pool on the right as opposed to a 20 pool on the left . as an aside it s unlikely that libertarians and greens would both pull 15 from their moderate counterparts because the democrat pool is larger than the republican pool . pulling proportionate to the pools would look more like this green 20 democrat 40 republican 25 libertarian 15 with that breakdown democrats still move right if they want more votes . also consider that these voter shifts are n't likely to take place in a single electoral cycle but rather be a drift . so as soon as the process starts democrats start moving right which is a very clear-cut decision . only if greens usurp republicans for 2nd place do democrats consider moving left . do you see that realistically happening anytime soon . gt is n't that a big part of the goal here . to turn politicians back into reps for the people instead of the corps . that s the goal but this is n't the path to it . campaign finance reform is . campaign finance reform that turns the people into the political funders makes politicians beholden to the people . currently politicians promise things people want then do things that wealthy corporate donors want . the people are upset but the funding does n't dry up for these liars it actually increases . the greater the war chest the less the disappointment of the people matters especially when all of the choices are corrupt in this way . advertising will control the masses . critical thinkers are rare . gt both the dems and the repubs have felt the sting of a 3rd party candidates costing them states or the presidency in the past . right and the people who voted for those 3rd party candidates got burned the worst by having their least favorite candidate win . it s the worst outcome for the 3rd party voter and then drives the moderate party counterpart closer to the center the more the 3rd party gains support . gt it ll kill the repubs once and for all and the dems will become the conservative party the dems would just be centrist not conservative . and they d have a strong centrist majority . the liberal agenda would not advance . some people might consider a solid center good but probably not the progressives who voted green and drove things in this direction . it s not the best outcome for them . voting democrat at least does n't facilitate the rightward shift . btw i m enjoying getting into these details and i thank you for this thoughtful discussion so far .

itsthenewdan	cj6xgua	1406242650	. what i would really love to know is did obama really believe that republicans would cooperate if he ignored standard negotiation tactics and instead extended the olive branch of compromise . was he really under the impression that this show of good faith would result in their cooperation . or was it part of some long-game strategy and if so did that strategy play out the way obama intended . did he perhaps feel that he needed years of proof of non-cooperation before getting combative . as a little aside i remember hearing neil degrasse tyson say that it was for this reason that he supported hillary over obama he knew that she already had a realistic/cynical view of republicans and would come out slugging .

itsthenewdan	cizdlie	1405545789	. gt everyone thinks like this . it is the core problem . no no no no no . this is pragmatic thinking and produces the best possible real world outcome . people are correct to vote this way given the current system . catch my caveat there . the voting system itself needs to change ideally to approval voting . so the first thing we need is campaign finance reform to kill corruption then we can push through voting system reform then 3rd party candidates will be viable . in the meantime pragmatism is best . vote pragmatically and be an activist for reforming the system so that at some time down the line you can vote with conviction without hurting your own self-interests .
itsthenewdan	clt57a2	1415144560	. right it s a purely pragmatic viewpoint . but what s even worse about option 2 is that the 10 of suppressed voters belong almost entirely to one party . that s just unfair . and these toxic laws are always sugarcoated in orwellian language . i actually think that linguistic choice is one place where the gop excels politically . they somehow manage to frame every debate with their terminology and it s always succinct and emotionally powerful stuff . the democrats never attempt to re-label with language from their viewpoint and so the media runs with the gop s language instead .
itsthenewdan	cj07jxq	1405623922	. i think it s awesome that you contact our reps . i do too . unfortunately i feel as though most of our comments fall upon ears that have been deafened by wealthy corporate interests but i still believe it s worthwhile because just maybe it makes the tiniest impact . it s also somewhat cathartic . as for the game theory rationale for why the rise of more extreme parties do n't cause more moderate parties to move closer here s how it works . let s just use real world examples as that will be the most straightforward . let s say that we start with this support breakdown green 5 democrat 55 republican 35 libertarian 5 green gains support siphons off 15 from democrat because we know they re not siphoning off of republican or libertarian now the support breakdown is green 20 democrat 40 republican 35 libertarian 5 democrats see that they re in trouble and look to bolster their numbers . they can move left to court green voters or move right to court republican voters . if they move left they have a 20 pool to draw from and might lose some voters to the republicans if they move right they have a 35 pool to draw from and might lose some voters to the greens moving right is the correct strategic decision for them because they have a larger pool to draw from and they lose votes to a weaker competing party rather than a stronger one . so that s how supporting the green party in spite of best intentions still keeps the democrats winning but actually drives them to the right . it s a bad outcome . alternative parties truly are n't viable with first past the post voting .

MorningLtMtn	cfbq2su	1392047034	. this is actually wrong . libertarianism is not reactive at all . it s very proactive . there is no right to pollute . polluting property which does not belong to you is inherently a crime . the problem is n't libertarianism the problem is corporatism there is no one who will have cuff slapped on them and personally held responsible for this crime because they are protected by a corporate shield . in a libertarian society this would be a crime and there would be people who are held personally accountable for their criminal actions in this crime starting with the person who pulled the lever and working up the chain of command . to imagine that this is some kind of libertarian problem misses the point this has nothing to do with libertarianism it does n't exist . regulations against this are unnecessary because it is inherently criminal to pollute property that does not belong to you . the regulations exist inherently . dumping waste into a river is an infringement without the need for regulations . to say that regulations would have prevented this misses the point . an actual system of justice where individuals in corporations are held liable would have prevented this but because they ve signed a piece of paper with the government the government chooses not to hold them accountable and worse the government will likely limit their liability . this is not a libertarian problem . this is a government problem .

MorningLtMtn	cfocs76	1393345866	. i wish i could agree with this . benghazi and the irs are both still very real and living issues that are only held at bay right now due to the partisan nature of congress . they re going to become even bigger issues after the november sweep and benghazi is probably going to be a key contributor in keeping hillary from running for president . a lot of people on the left want to pretend like there s nothing to that story but the deeper one digs the more unanswered questions come up on that one . also you forgot to add obama spying on the press to the list . that story has fallen apart but only because of the partisan nature of congress . no democrat wants to be the one to hold obama accountable . it s not going to be until the november sweep that any accountability on these things comes to being and republicans are n't going to be as lax on pursuing them as obama was in pursuing the stuff the bush got away with .
MorningLtMtn	cfbs7os	1392052249	. that s the point . they do n't in the current society . this is n't a libertarian problem . in a libertarian world infringments on life liberty and property would go punished regardless of corporate shield . your post makes no sense because you re asking me in what world we are living where uncodified regulations would have an impact . the answer is in a libertarian society . in the current society these actions go unpunished due to the government protecting the perpetrators regardless of regulations .

MorningLtMtn	cmlndvh	1417750135	. you re telling me that you ca n't instinctively understand that the increasing emergence of hd video streaming from sources like amazon netflix and hulu do n't equate to an increasing amount of traffic . this is the problem people are n't actually aware of what the bandwidth demands are now and they re certainly not aware of the bandwidth demands that we re going to require by 2020 . they are considerable . and this is only what we can see . there are still emerging aspects to technology that we ca n't see . nobody knows what it s really going to mean when 3d printed building plans start travelling out of massive datacenters . what everyone knows is that they want what they want even if the economics are n't there to support it . so right now they want net neutrality but only because they do n't understand that they re voting money out of their own pockets that would otherwise be coming out of netflix amazon and hulu s pockets . just like when obama was elected when there were people talking about how obama was going to pay for their gas and mortgage . that s what this is . the economics of net neutrality are oppressive on the end using consumer and go easy on the megolith corporations who are abusing the bandwidth and degrading the networks .
MorningLtMtn	cllxxeo	1414477489	. when the republicans win it will be because more people voted for them than voted for the democrats . that s because the democrats are good at campaigning but bad at governing and eventually that hurts their ability to campaign . we ve seen it again and again in recent history . if democrats ever figure out how to govern though .

SonnyBlack90	cjejurp	1406945206	. i as talking more about things like abortion access to contraception medicaid expansion etc . there are n't really any facts here . these are simply matters of preference and opinion . everything in this world is a trade-off and a lot of people are willing to make trade-offs that others would n't . so to someone in kansas not expanding medicaid may be worth it to not be tied down to those costs when the feds stop paying it all in however many years that is . same with access to contraceptives and abortion . many people are ok with not having employer provided contraceptives . many feel abortion is morally wrong . and it s not as simple as you re opinions do n't stand up to my facts . because whether these trade-ffs are good or bad is 100 subjective .
SonnyBlack90	cj8vm86	1406433017	. no i think democrats ant illegals in because a . they know they will be given amnesty soon b . their children are voting citizens . it s simple . republicans want white people to make up as high a of the voting base as possible democrats want white people as low a as possible . not because either party cares about any racial group whatsoever but because they know how racial groups vote and they want to win elections .

SonnyBlack90	cgiw8g2	1396511064	. gt what about the tax rates under eisenhower . why did n't the economy crash then . because everyone took deductions and credits and no one paid near the actual rate . gt do you think that vacuum would not be instantly filled by another person or corporate entity more than willing to still get quite wealthy instead of insanely wealthy . sure someone would . but the best would not settle for 450k a year when they could move to canada and make hundreds of millions . why would the ext bill gates stay here when he could move a few miles up north and make hundreds of times more money . also this whole scenario would absolutely wreck the stock market and investment in general as people would have no incentive to make more than 450k in a year .

SonnyBlack90	cgvevil	1397787747	. i know you said modern conservatism but still to act like it is just a white tribal movement is a bit dishonest in my opinion . would be like saying the modern liberal movement is just non whites trying to band together to end white america . there are millions of white liberals and millions of non white conservatives . do n't oversimplify things so that you can make the people you disagree with look bad . it is intellectually dishonest to do so . at some point the people on r/politics are going to have to accept that there are people in this country who believe a small government and powerful market are drivers of economic prosperity . they are n't all racist evil nazis who want to kill non white people . some people just have different economic ideas than us .

thetruthoftensux	clu2hxs	1415224084	. lets talk about assumptions here . you failed to actually read my posts in the thread . you only wanted vent . i can get that . 1 . i never complained about any of the things you said i complained about . wife and i make over 200k a year own 2 properties in one of the most expensive places in the states will retire in our late 50 s have zero education debt and are both in health care . you made this thread about some nebulous complaint that did n't happen . 2 . i have no issues with taxes i only commented on how some people lambast the idea that someone can make 100k and have difficulty living a middle class income based on the cost of living in their location . i vote straight democrat believe in progressive tax codes and am boggled by the stupidity of my countrymen and their voting habits . 3 . i fully support universal govt sponsored health care . how could i not i ve been in critcal care for 18 years and know better than most how the need for medical care can bankrupt families . 4 . as far as your profession you choose to do it with full knowledge of the pros and cons . that you feel it s underappricated makes no difference to anyone but you . i do n't feel for med students in residency they will work once their done and enter fellowship or take a position as an attending . that your willing to work for 40k with your education is what has me scratching my head . i d move to greener pastures in a heartbeat . in the end next time you want to rant make sure you actually read what you re replying to and understand the context . you re barking up the wrong tree .

thetruthoftensux	clouide	1414724369	. interesting . i m wondering if you re only in your early 20 s . i m well into my 40 s . and have been paying attention for longer than you ve likely been alive . you re cynical without experience to back it up . yep you are . and as more and more people act like you quiting because you do n't see an immediate result to your desires and wishes you ensure the country becomes more conservative and rolls back all the gains made in the first 2/3rd of the 20th century . but that s really ok to me . see i m in the 5 income bracket . i vote to the left and try to explain the issues with voting 3rd party or god forbit republican and i come across straight out stupidity like yours regularly . but again that s ok because if the country continues to go into the crapper my taxes go down . i ll still retire in my 50 s . my home will still be paid for i ll still have my health care . so feel free to encourage people to let the country decline . it actually benefits me .
thetruthoftensux	ciqy3tb	1404764805	. why would this be surprising . most people are fairly moderate and silent about thier politics . they fall into the middle of the left and right . the fringes are full of crazies . most people see them for what they are and while perhaps agreeing with one facet of their platform now and again they wo n't join them because most of the fringes beliefs are just plain nuts .
thetruthoftensux	ch256jr	1398467120	. i tend to find that when you challenge the average republican on the issues they claim not to support just about every one of the issues the party calls a platform . gun control is the only thing i ve seen them stick to and i agree with it . but when you claim not to support the xenophobia homophobia racism and fiscal irresponsiblity etc etc then perhaps you should consider yourself something other than republican .
thetruthoftensux	cjt21li	1408315226	. the idea of demilitarizing the police is not gon na happen . why . because you ca n't demilitarize the criminals or the 2nd amendment gun nuts who have contributed to the problem . as long as criminals have access to assault rifles tm and gun nuts scream how it s their god given right to own a howitzer the end result is the the police become a paramilitary organization . they will always have better hardware than the citizens . we created the problem with our gun loving culture so we get to live with the consequences .

thetruthoftensux	cltzmos	1415219408	. thanks i ll bring back my mean spirited comment for you as it seems to apply . you do n't appear to know shit regardless of your education as you ca n't seem to differentiate the idea that 100k in an expensive area might not be enough to achieve a middle class lifestyle . you instead go with the idea that that person is selfish and deserves to pay more taxes . that s a lack of understanding the varying degrees of economy vs locale . now for the more education/working harder . i ll say this you obviously picked the wrong degree insisted on sticking with it even when you knew it was dead end with regards to pay and are now bitter that you have to pay it off . what the hell would you know about the value of another persons work or how hard they worked to get to where they are . you are actually the bigger problem but i doubt you ll be able to see it because it may cause you to rethink your lifes path and that can be damn hard to do . i was n't complaining one way or the other in this thread i simply pointed out a lack of perspective regarding the 100k income vs location . you took it full retard .
thetruthoftensux	cjob7yf	1407870128	. because they are spouted by people who are full of shit most of the time . unions provide guidelines that management has to follow to fire someone . documented incompetence gets you fired pretty damn quick . most low level managers are too lazy or incompetent themselves to follow proper procedures with regards to firing union employees .
thetruthoftensux	cgv5kyw	1397766911	. i have to admit allowing companies to set up the big arrays on single family homes was a bad idea . i drive through mokulea and see several single family homes in a row with 100 panels each . definately screws up the saturation point for all the rest of the owners . ewa and mililani currently are screwed for most new installations and the perception is that heco is dragging it s feet to improve the infrastructure because it causes a loss of more customers . are you comfortable talking about any of these things . i wo n't put any employee on the spot with questions .
thetruthoftensux	cgeic58	1396046254	. i do n't know anyone who ever who considered their mortgage interest deductions as part of their overall purchase plan . if they did they should n't have been making the purchase since they did n't really have the income level for the purchase . if they got rid of the deduction people who bought homes they actually could afford would hardly blink . since most homes are bought buy people who can afford their mortgage it would n't effect purchase prices at all . the worst advice i ve ever heard was the uninformed do n't ever pay down your mortgage you want the interest deduction it come from people who have zero clue about finance .
thetruthoftensux	ciohels	1404491120	. as well he was n't radical enough for the far left . that s really why he s looked down on . no so much that the right hates him they hate anyone who is n't them . it s that many on the left feel he did n't go far enough to force universal health care and/or simply just release all the prisoners and close gitmo . the poll is just butthurt people on both sides .
thetruthoftensux	clort2t	1414719104	. yep and the more people do n't vote the more they allow more conservatives tea party etc to win because conservatives vote . then the entire spectrum continues to shift to the right as it has been for years . imagine if gore had n't lost due to the lefts fickleness . he lost florida by less than a thousand votes . those votes went to nader because people are idiots and think making a 3rd party statement vote is kool . that sort of voting leads to the conservative candidate winning in most cases . the system works as designed it s the populace and their apathy that allow the conservatives to stay in power . they do n't vote in primaries they do n't vote in mid term elections and they fracture their voting block between the democrats and all the other 3 party wastes . the right does n't even look to see who s on the ballot or what they stand for . they vote for their team and only care if their team wins .

thetruthoftensux	ch7l6yj	1399016780	. upvote to you . everyone who screams to double the minimum wage chooses to ignore all the skilled labor that currently demands higher than the minimum would be destroyed . your boss will not raise your wages he ll just chuckle at how your job just became a barely above minimum wage job . then when prices all increase they will very quickly you ll find that you re now poor just like everyone else who s making the new minimum wage .

thetruthoftensux	chum0s0	1401423129	. laughable your link compares us to finland denmark norway and canada . can you find smaller countries with more homgenous societies exclude canada that value education to compare us too . the u.s worships ignorace and materialism so you can expect people to scream how they are n't getting what they deserve . some work hard and fail . that s life but millions more scream how unfair it is for them but looking closely at them you d find they really did n't do much to get ahead . i run into 30 year old kids who quit at everything that requires any real work or dedication all the time .
thetruthoftensux	chvta3g	1401561350	. no one will do shit in this country until they ve been starving for a decade . admit it were coddled lazy and love to blame others . in countries with civil strife do you ever see a fat poor person . countries where the bulk of the population have it rough have it rough for 50 years before they decide dodging a bullet is a better option than eating a happy meal watching american idol on their smart phone while complaining on reddit how hard they have it . the current generation has it no rougher than any before it . they re just not willing to relocate do a job that does n't fulfill them avoid having multiple kids with people they barely know or like or admit that anything that slightly irritates them is not the fucking apocalypse . here s a real truth in life and it s been this way since the beginning . it take most of a persons life to become successful meaning wealthy enough to be comfortable and take life s hits in stride . the current generation has been riding mommy and daddy s coat tails for so long they think that level of success should just be handed to them thus they are lazy and like to complain . they will be the working poor for most of their lives because they really think life should be easy . deal with it .

thetruthoftensux	cib0ivx	1403122859	. a fair enough assessment . i simply disagree with the numbers that you would think would support any uprising . it s so easy this day and age to get on the news label a group as the bad guy and get most of the populace to hate them and aid in their destruction . propaganda is like steak to most of our populace . imagine an small but popular uprising starts somewhere . it has local support but gets painted to the rest of the country as nutters who want to seceed from the union does n't have to be true . then they get painted as killers who want to take from you anyone else in the country . the taking part can be a total lie but most people will believe it . from then it s simply getting volunteers from the rest of the country that is completely uninformed about what s really happening in the area of uprising to join up and gleefully kill everyone they ve been told is the enemy . think it ca n't happen . look at the last 2 wars we fought .

bluefootedpig	clttuyw	1415209683	. taxes account for externalities . such as pollution and things that your average citizen must pay . soda is the number 1 cause of obesity and we as a society allow anyone to visit an er . obesity is costing everyone who pays taxes . so we tax it to put the burden on the people who use it . so if we are going to say that anyone can visit the er even obese people then if we have a huge cause of obesity those that consume said product should have to help foot the bill for the services that people with similar habits use . just like we have a tax on gas to pay for roads . cars wear down roads so we tax people use gas to help pay for the improvement . as someone who does n't use roads i use trails and live very close to where i work why should i have to foot an equal share of the road when i never use it . so these taxes are to more directly tax those that cause the problems that we as a society must pay for .
bluefootedpig	cil6sx8	1404165285	. i can . i would have been fine if it stopped with sole proprietors and llcs but corporations are going too far even more so that public corps were not excluded . now walmart which owns 50 and is one of the largest employers can declare their christian values and evade the law . but here is what gets me is this is basically a subsidy for hl . they wo n't pay for this additional care which they invest in and instead government will pay for it . so government means the taxpayer you and i will be footing the bill for millions so hl can up their profit by a quarter of a percent . in an ideal world you would challenge the law not how the law affects you . either no one or everyone . this is the basis of john lockes society the one we try to live in . rather this was challenging it on how you feel . here is my simple test . can a citizen do the same thing hl is doing . can i disagree with a law on religious grounds and not have to do it . if i am drafted can i claim religion stops me and thus not be drafted . when people tried this we said too bad you can help fuel jets then . you still had to pay up . hl got out of even paying . i bet in less than 6 months they will make up the loss that it cost to fight this .

bluefootedpig	cihylxh	1403819261	. i am rehashing a really good article that i ca n't find okay i m lazy and did n't even try but it basically showed that during the great depression charity money ran dry . the big givers of charity simply were not giving as much . but something interesting happened when we started the social programs . people were upset that charities would be out of business because why would you need a charity to feed the poor if they could get foodstamps . well we started feeding the poor and a few charities went out of business . but the ones that did n't stopped feeding the poor and started doing other things for the poor like jobs programs or giving clothing or helping them write resumes etc . basically with the limited resources of a charity by the government doing the heavy lifting charities were able to help the people who needed it . this is not how health care works but let me try to do the food stamp issue into hc . what would happen is we would suddenly have a single payer system that covered common things like check ups and cancer things that just about all of us get . charities would no longer need to help the poor get health care . rather the charities would now focus on rare diseases ones not covered by government remember government only covers the most common issues . so the 1 year old kid with the rare genetic condition gets help and care that they would otherwise not get . the big reason why we did this shift was because during bad times charities got less money and we determined this was a time when we need to make sure people were fed . because lack of funds plus a high demand created long bread lines we fixed the problem by making sure that funds would not be limited or at lest not as much . i hope that helped i was once huge on the let charities handle it . until i realized charities do n't want to handle it they want to handle special make a wish cases and you ca n't do make a wish if your entire budget is spent on feeding the homeless .

bluefootedpig	cixhd9f	1405377803	. okay so people seem to fail at fascism at least according to me . fascism is state influenced free markets . this is why it was called the 3rd way between capitalism and communism . you have private ownership private companies etc but you use policy to do a sort of central planning . america is fascist we just do n't call it that . why is it fascist . we give tax breaks to certain companies and hike taxes on others that is fascism . state trying to control the private industry via policy . the key thing to remember is that the state does n't care if your tobacco company goes under due to high taxes the government says smoking is bad and thus will tax it to death . so fascism as you might image gets confused with merging corporations with state power because if you are a corporation doing what the government wants you get more money better tax breaks etc . if we decided green energy was the way of the future all subs would be cut to oil and given to green tech . that again would be a fascist move .

bluefootedpig	ci4cety	1402444384	. it is fear mongering to an extent but have you watched what the right sells . i say sells because that is a good gauge of how the people feel . gold durable goods guns etc . those are sold on right-wing news why would you sell gold and emergency survival stuff . the only reason they would be advertising there is if the news was priming them for it . the right-wing news media pumps out fear and now people are beyond just buying gold and emergency kits they are killing as well . while it might be just some crazy people how do you tell a crazy person from a normal person . how many people were willing to fight and kill police officers so a welfare rancher could keep using public land for free . the problem is people who are paranoid and have mental illness look to guns for protection . the bigger problem is we can not tell someone has a mental illness until it is too late . as pointed out this guy was crazy hey he legally had all his guns .
bluefootedpig	cikxk60	1404146888	. yes you do . a company does n't pay the overhead for have separate benefits packages it simply is n't cost effective . so if a union representing even as little as 30 gets a contract everyone will benefit . i have seen very few places offer split compensation and even fewer offer it at any significant differences . the reason you do n't is if someone is paid more less than their peers one or the other will be pissed and work poorly . so to prevent that a union contract will generally apply to everyone union or not .

bluefootedpig	cila2o1	1404172390	. the big difference is the clinton law was to stop government from banning something religion did . this is completely opposite it is government trying to give something . the gov is not banning anything or stopping them from doing something . it is giving the people a standard health care . think about it if the case was opposite government wanted to ban companies providing birth control and a company saying it is our faiths belief in providing health care for all employees which covers conception . notice how when you flip it it makes sense in light of the clinton law .
bluefootedpig	cjpcrso	1407959943	. true but do you think the president and fbi would be investigating it if it was a peaceful protest . one way or another the rioting brought attention to the situation . one that when rioting does n't happen justice is rarely served . the real problem is it takes rioting to get police to do the right thing .
bluefootedpig	celkbp9	1389301230	. so when the countries most busy bridge has a random shutdown to the point the mayor is making calls looking for help he does n't look into it . later someone asks him about it and he makes a sarcastic joke . for such a huge colossal screw up he sure was n't interested to finding out why it happened until this occurred .
bluefootedpig	cjpcq94	1407959868	. to re-enforce your idea look at gun shots vs tazers . when tazers came out they thought use of guns would drop as officers have a new less lethal means . the results was the number of gun shots basically stayed the same but use of mace went down . the amount of use the tazer sees is more than gun shots yet gunshots did n't go down at all . so yeah they abuse it and more non-lethal it is the more it is gets used .
bluefootedpig	cllf6r7	1414439437	. or like when a law was passed that showed the nutrition of each item . it means labeling 99.9 of the food with these labels and who does n't know what is in products . i think those against gmo labeling should read up on nutrition labeling because they sound exactly the same .
bluefootedpig	cihylxh	1403819261	. i am rehashing a really good article that i ca n't find okay i m lazy and did n't even try but it basically showed that during the great depression charity money ran dry . the big givers of charity simply were not giving as much . but something interesting happened when we started the social programs . people were upset that charities would be out of business because why would you need a charity to feed the poor if they could get foodstamps . well we started feeding the poor and a few charities went out of business . but the ones that did n't stopped feeding the poor and started doing other things for the poor like jobs programs or giving clothing or helping them write resumes etc . basically with the limited resources of a charity by the government doing the heavy lifting charities were able to help the people who needed it . this is not how health care works but let me try to do the food stamp issue into hc . what would happen is we would suddenly have a single payer system that covered common things like check ups and cancer things that just about all of us get . charities would no longer need to help the poor get health care . rather the charities would now focus on rare diseases ones not covered by government remember government only covers the most common issues . so the 1 year old kid with the rare genetic condition gets help and care that they would otherwise not get . the big reason why we did this shift was because during bad times charities got less money and we determined this was a time when we need to make sure people were fed . because lack of funds plus a high demand created long bread lines we fixed the problem by making sure that funds would not be limited or at lest not as much . i hope that helped i was once huge on the let charities handle it . until i realized charities do n't want to handle it they want to handle special make a wish cases and you ca n't do make a wish if your entire budget is spent on feeding the homeless .
bluefootedpig	cgayzc2	1395701593	. another boo who article . the author feels that expecting things of children is too demanding on them . that saying we expect you add two dice together is somehow going to make a child fail . the author calls for a throw back to the days when we were producing failed children but ignored it . those were the glory days . now a first grader is expected to add single digits . oh the horror .
bluefootedpig	cffmfum	1392424850	. actually we ca n't get rid of it because humans judge best when given 2 options . give a person more options they are more likely to make a bad choice . the best system is multi-tier that presents 2 people each level like the play offs . you would ideally match weaker candidates to stronger ones . it would take longer but would yield the best result . the other thing is that voting needs to be open primaries . otherwise the middle of a closed party is farther left or farther right . open primaries will give centrist people more sway as they win over the people who are voting in their primary from the other side .
bluefootedpig	cil6sx8	1404165285	. i can . i would have been fine if it stopped with sole proprietors and llcs but corporations are going too far even more so that public corps were not excluded . now walmart which owns 50 and is one of the largest employers can declare their christian values and evade the law . but here is what gets me is this is basically a subsidy for hl . they wo n't pay for this additional care which they invest in and instead government will pay for it . so government means the taxpayer you and i will be footing the bill for millions so hl can up their profit by a quarter of a percent . in an ideal world you would challenge the law not how the law affects you . either no one or everyone . this is the basis of john lockes society the one we try to live in . rather this was challenging it on how you feel . here is my simple test . can a citizen do the same thing hl is doing . can i disagree with a law on religious grounds and not have to do it . if i am drafted can i claim religion stops me and thus not be drafted . when people tried this we said too bad you can help fuel jets then . you still had to pay up . hl got out of even paying . i bet in less than 6 months they will make up the loss that it cost to fight this .

bluefootedpig	ciqr3i4	1404751791	. here you are wrong because look at the reason they were allowed to not buy any amount of legally required items . i have religious objections to many more than 4 out of the 20 do i get to opt out in the individual market or do corps have more rights than me .

bluefootedpig	cg6vqfr	1395267673	. because it was originally implemented as a way to get around a 90 income tax . the wealthy wanted to get more pay but at 90 tax money did n't work . so they lobbied and got it as a tax write off . so it was originally only for wealthy management then unions happened and got it for everyone . we ca n't get rid of it because to do so would be to give insurance to lazy people without jobs while those with jobs have insurance so why change things .
bluefootedpig	ciqrc5p	1404752244	. not to mention free . there are many people who live in cities who do not have a car or other form of id and even more so one that is accepted depending on the state different requirements . there are an amazing amount of poor people with less than 100 dollars in savings and people expect them to shell out 20-50 bucks for a voter id . should n't voting me important enough that any cost no matter how small should be done away with .
bluefootedpig	cikxqxc	1404147266	. seems like maybe the right had a good plan . make sure single payers ca n't pass instead suggest a private sector solution . then when the vote comes up no one votes for it . now we get companies to fight it . this way companies pay for the legal challenges that congress is too scared to vote on . you think congress would vote to restrict plan b . republcian s would n't be able to do the whole we do n't hate women as they vote away plan b .
bluefootedpig	ci139tb	1402095801	. i got into conspiracies for awhile . to me it was the idea of knowing secret knowledge . the desire to be right when everyone else is wrong . it took my pastor telling me only gay men have facial hair after i showed him the ot commandment not to shave . i left and only looked back once or twice i mean come on who never looks back .

bluefootedpig	cjahv74	1406590558	. true but i thought if a state law was in place but a federal law differed the federal law still held . like many states did n't ratify blacks to have a right to vote but the federal government still gave it to them . i would think at the very least this would bring up a scotus on civil liberties .
bluefootedpig	cejqnhm	1389121132	. well when you see the ugly beast i can see how others might come to your conclusion . it is like trying to defend bankers making over 1m a year before bonuses . you can argue it maybe even make sense but it is really difficult for the average person to see it as anything other than greed . the same is here you can defend the republican side but if you look at what they are promoting in general it is a return to a time before we tried to fix things which are better now . so why would you return to a time when things were worse . before ss we had a 40 homeless rate among the elderly now we have 15 . that is a huge reduction for a fairly small price of ss . republicans would have us return to 40 homeless among the elder . see the problem is n't about what to do it is about doing it . republicans do not give alternatives they give you nothing . they want repeal . there is no solid health care plan alternative from the right . no solid immigration etc . basically from what i have seen being a moderate conservative is that the right tends to offer the only solution of nothing . how do you fix taxes . remove them . how do you fix healthcare . remove government help . how do you fix higher education . end public education . see . the problem i see is republicans do n't offer solutions or even see a problem it is like they forgot to look at history at what it was like before public education . before social security . it was horrible for many and good for a few . so i do n't see r/politics as convincing you to vote democrat what i see is a mirror being held up and even republicans are ashamed at their own party .
bluefootedpig	ceku7rf	1389224460	. well since 2006 when the law started to be implemented we have seen a record low inflation rate . last year 2013 the rate was below inflation first time since 1970 . so if anything we can see that since the law started the costs have stabled greatly .

MrWigglesworth2	ck84dhl	1409762346	. you ca n't ask people to prove negatives . you both posted numbers . his are from a federal agency covering the entire country . yours is from a student newspaper at a single school . so he s right your numbers are n't credible . even if they are accurate they re only applicable to a single school .
MrWigglesworth2	cf6xu02	1391539359	. kleck represents the extreme high end of the range . hemenway represents the extreme low end of the range . an intermediate estimate taken from the ncvs is likely the most accurate . the cdc cites all three of these and more i m not sure how your unable to find anything but kleck .
MrWigglesworth2	ckushtx	1411923613	. gt not one that was cited here and while i am on it how would anyone be able to come up with that number . i provided the link in another post but here you go . . no you get to have a gun regardless that s well established fact and evident to anyone with junior high level reading comprehension . being in a militia is not a prerequisite to owning a weapon owning a weapon is a prerequisite to being in a militia . so in the interest of making sure people can form a militia their right to own weapons shall not be infringed . gt bullshit bullshit bullshit your link goes to imger and nowhere does it mention the fbi or the cdc . the data on the chart is from the fbi and cdc . you can go have a look for yourself . fbi homicide rate data for all 50 states . if you want to actually do the math on it that data has a correlation coefficient of 0.007 . in otherwords zero . gt so in your world democrats filibuster legislation written by other democrats . no-no silly bear as usual the republican s filibuster anything and everything that has a chance to move no democrats put up entirely objectionable laws that do far more than just universal background checks and where they do implement universal background checks they do it in a completely stupid and hamfisted manner . then when the republicans offer proposals for universal background checks that actually make sense the democrats do n't even let those on the floor while whining the the republicans are n't letting them through .
MrWigglesworth2	cjuo7oi	1408466293	. gt here s something more realistic for you to think about . are you promoting your blog or something . that article is as goofy as the trans-homo-normative dystopia fiction check your privilege stories that get posted on 4chan . at least those are meant to be a joke .
MrWigglesworth2	clb0bf6	1413462961	. gt assuming rent is low 800 a month 800 a month is not low . even in nyc or san fransisco you can find accommodations for half that . claiming its not a living wage because it does not enable you to live as comfortably as you think you deserve is exactly what people are talking about when they use that word . entitlement .
MrWigglesworth2	cizxqeg	1405604753	. gt the gun control issue is literally like 1/9th of what the dems spend their time on . and that makes their campaign to suppress a fundamental civil right okay . nope . gt and 90 percent of the guns owned have been completely unaffected by anything they ve passed . at the federal level maybe but this is not for lack of trying . i m glad i do n't live in a state run by anti gun idiots like new york or california or maryland though where the restrictions are a lot more broad and a lot more severe . and these are restrictions that democrats have been attempting to bring to the federal level . so the argument that they are n't even doing anything is just nonsense .
MrWigglesworth2	cfpmcwq	1393459306	. it s funny how alike they are in their tactics too . an outright ban violates the constitution . so instead they nibble around the perimeter and make it as difficult and expensive as possible.waiting periods . categorical bans what kind you can get . going after the providers with insane regulations .

MrWigglesworth2	ckxjhyg	1412179597	. so six anecdotes prove what exactly . this does nothing to back up your baseless assertion . there are 30,000 gun deaths per year 20,000 of which are suicide . there are 130,000 total gun injuries including fatalities per year . but there are over one hundred million gun owners in this country . the likelihood of an individual gun owner hurting someone is tiny .
MrWigglesworth2	cl6wd0c	1413070191	. gt no they are n't . they re telling you the truth . you really are throwing your vote away . even worse you are potentially helping the party you like the least get elected . i dislike the two main parties pretty much equally . i give zero shits whether a republican or democrat is in power . i d rather vote for someone i actually agree with . gt you have n't given this much thought but you re comfortable judging people who have thought about it quite a lot . how do you know how much thought i ve given this . you do n't stop talking out of your ass .
MrWigglesworth2	cf2s6wc	1391100114	. gt wait did n't you just say gang members are the cause of all those child/teen deaths . would n't they also likely have less means . so your contention is that we should infringe on the rights of all poor people in order to target a small subset of them . that does n't sound very progressive at all .

MrWigglesworth2	cmbwq4x	1416862446	. gt there is no wide-scale movement to completely ban guns there s absolutely many people seeking a complete ban . there s many more people seeking to ban only any kind of weapon invented in the last century . i also find it comical that you claim no one wants to ban guns while simultaneously citing countries that did exactly that as examples to follow . if there s anything making discussion impossible it s the rampant and flagrant dishonesty of gun control advocates .
MrWigglesworth2	cljg8lq	1414254734	. gt heck despite popular understanding the new interpretation did n't even officially enter law until 2008 with heller all previous case law operated on the original meaning . no . there was very little case law at all before heller and what there was does not support your claims . the last significant case before that was united states v miller all the way back in 1939 . in that case the defendents were charged for violating the national firearms act by possessing a short-barreled shotgun . the defendants challenges that the nfa s prohibition of short-barreled shotguns violated the 2nd amendment . the government argued that the second amendment protects only the ownership of military-type weapons appropriate for use in an organized militia . the court accepted that argument and ruled in the governments favor . it should be noted that neither the defendants nor anyone representing them were even present at supreme court hearings and no arguments were made in their favor . short barrel shotguns were in fact quite popular with militaries at the time but no one was present to make that argument . miller is n't a very good case to set precedent off of and what precedent it does set is the government can restrict certain weapons if they are n't useful for a militia . heller merely extended that standard to say that the 2nd amendment protected weapons in common use for lawful purpose thus striking down dc s ban on handguns .
MrWigglesworth2	ciiso9s	1403901565	. gt there is no reason it should be illegal in that it damages anyone unfairly . except it does . it deprives networks of rebroadcasting fees and advertisement views . gt it s only illegal because nothing like it has been legal before but that s because it has n't existed before . the business model is n't different in any significant way from cable companies . it s rebroadcasting network broadcasts for a profit . that they do it over the internet instead of a coaxial cable is immaterial . cable companies pay for the right to rebroadcast . aereo was not . they had an unconventional technical solution that was purpose-built to try and skirt the law that requires payment of rebroadcasting fees . the courts ruled that they were in fact still in violation of those laws despite their attempt to skirt those laws . whatever technical and legal chicanery they may have been attempting the fact is they were n't doing anything all that new . and the fact is it s only a problem because they re making a business out of it . if you as a television consumer want to place an antenna on top of a hill where you get good reception hook it up to a dvr and a slingbox there s nothing stopping you . if you want to do this en masse and turn it into a profitable business now you ve got a problem . and at the end of the day this does n't really impact aereo that much anyway . they can pay rebroadcasting fees it s usually around 2 per subscriber . all it means is that their service is now 10-15/month instead of 4 something plenty of people will still pay for .
MrWigglesworth2	cl9hemb	1413318673	. gt i m an intelligent hahaha no . gt but nice try with more ad hominem attacks because libertarianism ca n't stand on its merits . nope . you do n't get to whine about this when you ve never once advanced an argument . all you ve done is insist you re right over and over again . you ve offered nothing of substance whatsoever and when this is pointed out all you ve done is double down on this stance and insist you do n't need to back up your rancid bullshit because you just do n't .
MrWigglesworth2	ckcjzyq	1410193485	. does n't matter . i do n't give a shit about those other wedge issues and as a matter of fact i oppose the gop s position on them . i m in favor of rights for samesex couples . i m in favor of legal accessible abortion . i m in favor of immigration reform . i have no love for the gop s position on these issues . i also happen to take the entire bill of rights seriously which is why i do n't vote for democrats right now . if they stopped trying to shit on this particular civil liberty i might be inclined to vote for them . i m not saying i definitely would but i would at least consider it . until then it s an automatic no to any candidate with a d next to their name . for what its worth the same goes for the republicans and those positions on other wedge issues . until they drop that shit it s an automatic no to any candidate with an r next to their name . the way i feel about this is not uncommon .
MrWigglesworth2	cfv1nto	1394037574	. you would also be hard pressed to find any other organization offering as much in benefits to so many employees . the fact is the benefits offered by the usps are unsustainable without being subsidized by tax payers . whether that tax payer funding comes now or a few decades from now is the only difference .
MrWigglesworth2	ci7r4c1	1402793065	. gt studies have footnotes footnotes are important get over it . yes . studies have footnotes . most studies use footnotes to cite sources when using someone else s data or answer questions a reader might have not to bury critical information that radically alters the context of the conclusions being advanced . most authors also do not leave that critical contextual information out when publicizing their work . people that do leave it out as everytown and the rest of the gun control movement have done are usually doing so because they do n't want people to consider that context when they read a headline . gt if you just read a soundbite blurb of the findings you are not getting the whole story no shit that s the entire problem here . gt but only in the case of firearms where you are so emotionally invested do you consider that immutable fact to be indicative of a conspiracy . that s why your argument here is bad . it s implying ill animus with no evidence exclusively because the results make you feel uncomfortable . no i consider it indicative of someone with shitty arguments . that it s on the subject of firearms has nothing to do with it . if someone released a study on the number of deaths in the fishing industry and then quietly mentioned in the footnotes that they were including fishermen who committed suicide people who died in boating accidents that had nothing to do with fishing people killed by aquatic wildlife and people who died after eating sushi that would be just as stupid and dishonest as the shit everytown is trying to pull . if a study like that were released by someone opposed to the fishing industry say the national cattlemen s beef association i d also question the motivations behind the study as well .
MrWigglesworth2	cmbndmu	1416845383	. it s been explained to you on several occasions in this thread why miller does nothing to suggest a collective right . miller is a pretty shitty case to be basing precedent on in the first place given that the defense was n't even present to argue and that the conclusion that short-barreled shotguns were unsuitable for militia use was unfounded given the popularity of short-barred shotguns with militaries of the day . regardless if we take the miller ruling as legitimate precedent all it did was uphold restrictions on the transportation across state lines of certain uncommon weapons if they would not be suitable for militia use . it sure as shit does not make being in a militia a prerequisite to own any firearms at all or make owning a firearm a collective right .

MrWigglesworth2	cggr9g9	1396299551	. not even close . i ll repeat and we re ignoring that another proposal was offered on background checks that would have been just as if not more effective while being less of a burden on gun owners . a proposal that most people on the pro-gun side fully supported . harry reid killed it without it ever being debated . if you want background checks on private sales it has been offered . the gun control crowd is n't accepting that proposal though ostensibly because it does n't burden gun control owners enough to sate their need to stick it to them .
MrWigglesworth2	cjit9ei	1407355562	. gt . in 2012 . the temperatures in 2012 were higher than the average temperatures for the past few years . all that indicates is that 2012 was hotter than average . it does n't suggest an overall warming trend over those years . for all we know 2011 and 2013 were cooler . more importantly this particular algae bloom was not actually abnormally large compared to past ones that happen with regularity in lake erie . it just happened to be localized near toledo and forced by abnormal wind patterns to stay in that particular location longer than it normally would which led to the build up of toxins .
MrWigglesworth2	cj0alm4	1405629417	. obama said he had no intention of running for president in 2006 . frankly the parallels between warren and obama are pretty strong . both are/were freshmen senators that had managed to generate this cult of personality about them by making high-profile speeches and statements despite being new to the national political scene . i d be more surprised if she didn't throw he hat in the ring .
MrWigglesworth2	cljfc56	1414252556	. the nra does n't give a shit about universal background checks . they do give a shit about the defacto registration and needless fees that will accompany the proposals democrats put forward . the republicans put forward universal background check proposals without that other crap attached . harry reid wo n't even let them up for discussion .
MrWigglesworth2	cik4gai	1404061148	. well those ratings were nonsense anyway . any reasonable quantification would have the us quite a bit higher . the who included the degree to which healthcare is publicly funded as one of the things they looked at which is obviously quite a bit lower in the us compared to other countries . the us was at or near the top in quality availability responsiveness all the actually important shit . but we do n't achieve those results through a publicly funded system so we re 37th on their bullshit metric .
MrWigglesworth2	cfpv265	1393478992	. gt because letting perfect be the enemy of good is usually a stupid point . this is the basis of much of the gun advocacy argument . except it is n't good . it inflates costs while giving very little benefit . if you can find a cheaper way of doing it that is n't so easily defeated that s fine . but for now microstamping requirements are nothing but an underhanded attempt at making guns more difficult for law abiding citizens to acquire . gt where the weapons became prevalent in mexico it created more problems . this should be a cautionary tale but as usual when it comes go guns no risk is too great . and yet it was n't an issue here whatsoever . it only correlates with an increase in a completely different country a country which has far stricter gun laws . gt which is why the increase in violence was correlated regionally to where no statewide awb s existed an not where the cartels were warring with each other . huh . the fighting has almost exclusively taken place in mexican states bordering texas and new mexico . the tijuana cartel controls everything south of california and they have n't been embroiled in the wars the same way the others have . gt kind of hard to cherry pick only the data from 2007-2008 when you re using the previous years data prior to the lift of the law as your reference . and yet they found a way to claim that a slight upward trend in homicide rates from 2002 through 2007 into 2008 followed by a downward trend since somehow indicates the law in question results in substantially increased homicide rates .
MrWigglesworth2	ck30tcz	1409250884	. the legislation in question benefits gun manufacturers and gun dealers . the nra opposes that legislation . why would they do that if they re backed by weapons manufacturers who s sole purpose is to sell guns . i do n't think you have a clue what you re talking about and you ve got some real balls to call anyone else deluded .

Jae_Siever	cilbshy	1404176294	. you are very correct obama has his flaws and faults some of which i happily point to and say we can do better . but we find ourselves in a bit of a pickle while the obama administration has it s problems most sane people know it could be much much worse under another george w bush administration or a mitt romney . the healthcare bill for example is a massive give away to the insurance industry and is basically nothing more than de-regulation in that sector . it will serve a purpose of course but again we could do better . as much as conservatives hate obama he is basically doing everything they want and more . if it were n't for the racial issue and his name he would be the new ronald reagan in their eyes .
Jae_Siever	cjkdgbj	1407489724	. this keeps pressure and attention on water pollution . our water quality has gotten better over the last say 20 years but it s only as a result of regulation and more public attention . if people simply ignored this and waved it off it would lead to more polluted water . i m all for a little fear-mongering when it comes to keeping our water safe and drinkable . ideally i d like 0 towns out of tends of thousands not having access to drinking water . but maybe you re right . fuck those guys how dare they have access to water .
Jae_Siever	cixj7th	1405381748	. hydraulic fracturing uses 4.4 million gallons of fresh water every year per drilling site . that s a conservative estimate and the amount might be higher . most of the water is then un-treatable by water treatment facilities as our facilities in the u.s are not equipped to handle the amount of heavy metals and unknown chemicals that are trade secrets in the fracturing industry s water waste . i think the one or two facilities in the u.s that are trying to treat the water are finding it to be an incredibly costly endeavor which may not even be effectively removing the harmful concoction from the water to make it usable again . that and it s pretty damn expensive and on-going . of course that does n't apply to california but it s more toward the people who are all against sending california fresh water from their own state . billions of gallons of fresh water are being sent to fracturing sites around the country already and california on the other hand is one of the biggest contributors to the united states in terms of tax dollars . i d say pipe it over and then force the farms to modernize their irrigation system like that guy in japan did source .
Jae_Siever	ci9py5u	1403004734	. they also have less natural resources and less human resources to work with . and the larger population in capitalism is an advantage . quite simply put we have more people to sell trinkets to but our people do n't have the money so our economy is floundering . we have a lot of crap to sell but not enough people to buy it locally because they do n't make enough . meanwhile rent has sky-rocketed and the cost of living is n't that different between the u.s and aus .
Jae_Siever	ciwj469	1405289548	. research has shown that snap is a very effective stimulus to the economy . for every dollar snap uses it pays back 1.25-1.75 in economic activity . that may not make a lot of sense until you realize that inside the united states we throw away a massive amount of food every year . snap basically takes what would otherwise go into the trash and sends it to people who really needs it . it lowers crime hungry people do n't stay hungry for long it increase economic activity demand job creation more consumers it is one of the best run government programs less than 1 of fraud and really they could expand it and it would be a pretty massive benefit to the entire economy because we still have so much food in the u.s being thrown out anyway . good investment all things considered .
Jae_Siever	ci9pub4	1403004221	. high skill jobs are currently low paying too . if everyone developed a skill it would n't really be much of a skill now would it . we have very skilled people who have run the numbers and found that all it would take to cover the differences is a price increase of 3 to 20 cents on appetizers and entrees at restaurants . that applies to the restaurant industry at least . but it gets better . your way of thinking is deeply flawed because they are n't exactly lowering prices with how badly the u.s wages have stagnated and decreased . they tend to price things at what the consumer is willing to pay regardless of what the consumer earns . if i charge you ten dollars for a bottle of imported water you bet your sweet bippy i m not going to suddenly drop my price just because i pay the person who sells my product 1 penny an hour . i m going to charge what you are willing to pay for it . the price of fuel has a larger impact on small and large businesses than the minimum wage going up by a god damn dollar does . and you re a fool if you do n't realize that .

Jae_Siever	cjdmuj3	1406861476	. many of the companies who are moving are currently taking tax payer subsidies or getting tax breaks already . the real tax rate for them is 14 or less . some pay no taxes and get money on top of that . it s a really rigged system in big business s favor . of course that wo n't stop them from pushing the limits and wanting more . no matter how much the people and the government give them they ll always come back demanding more . we re already paying them in the hopes they ll invest some of it back into the country trickle down for the last 12+years but that has n't worked out so well . investment and general entrepreneurship has dropped drastically over the last 12+years and is only held up from hitting rock bottom by one person s charity/investments . and that person is named warren buffet .
Jae_Siever	cisshza	1404933103	. i ve always been fascinated with the labels people impose on themselves and others for simple likes and dislikes . in all honesty it seems like very few people are actually conservative and very few people are liberal . and for the extreme on each side they label anyone who disagrees with them the other what happens if a person is pro-choice and pro-gun .

Jae_Siever	cjl4xnn	1407553560	. truth hurts i m sorry mitt romney pushed it in his state years before obama tried it . you d think they would support their own healthcare bill . do n't feel bad if i had to defend republicans or democrats i d run away from debates and facts too .
Jae_Siever	ciu5615	1405047522	. i ve seen a lot of both parties are bad posts but this is the only one that gets to the truth of the issue without all the fanfare . all the faults of the republican party are well documented and most of the complaints about the obama administration are so far-fetched it alienates otherwise rationale people from seeing the faults of obama and in general cowardly democratic politicians . if people used those issues against obama at debates and attacked him for that then they d have a foot to stand on . but they wo n't instead it s benghazi and obama being a communislamist .

Jae_Siever	cifiu28	1403587052	. a bit of a strange thing is n't it . i thought liberals were soft on crime and yet here we have an example of prisoners claiming their conditions are inhumane . which should please conservatives should n't it . and yet conservatives will complain about liberal california being liberal and hard on prisoners . weird .
Jae_Siever	cin3kyv	1404346089	. as bad as that was it s nice to see some attempted change . a ipad overall is still probably slightly cheaper than the mountain of books some kids use..unfortunately the books tend to last longer and no one really tries to steal them . they should just go with e-readers you can find some decent enough ones for 25 dollars . some slightly average ones run 40 and the knock your socks off brands are 100-300 .

Jae_Siever	cjfw1eu	1407093973	. i remember that the prisoners hated the work . they were smashing and spitting on the produce and it was considered a failure . last i read the farm owners were demanding the laws be over turned . all of georgia s neighboring states on the other hand had a pretty large boost in economic activity with the new arrivals . they were offering to pay americans in georgia 10 an hour plus x amount of change per box of peaches harvested . it did n't get any traction .
Jae_Siever	cj9t8pd	1406528990	. who dies in war . i ll give you a hint . it is n't the mitt romney s or the koch brothers of the country . whether the wars are justified or good for the country is up for debate but realistically who pays the human price . the poor the working and the middle class fight and die in wars . but that soldier should have just been born rich right . how dare he die or come back maimed and look for a hand out . the nerve of those guys you ve changed my mind . we should tax wounded soldiers double because they do n't contribute enough tax dollars . and while we re at it we should have statues of the top 1 crafted so we do n't miss an opportunity to give them their deserved credit . 1 and that in itself is why a flat tax would only benefit the wealthy further than a currently rigged system already does . they are n't suffering having to pay a meager of their overall wealth back to the country that allowed them to succeed to begin with . public schools give them educated workers our roads allow them to transport their goods the very existence of the working and middle class allows them to be wealthy . if every single farm hand disappeared tomorrow it would be a massive blow to the economy . if every single billionaire disappeared tomorrow we d have brand new billionaires or several new millionaires overnight . essentially they ve used and became successful now it s time for them to pay it back so other people can also enjoy safe roads clean water and an opportunity to earn a living . if they want to go and fight on the front lines then i d support returning soldiers being completely exempt from taxation for as long as they live . 2 they have contributed wealth wealth that would n't exist if not for the country itself . they provided the wealth but did n't provide the labor planning nor did they transport the materials . african slaves did most of the labor and building and to them we should owe a debt . i m sorry but all the rich did was put forth some money they did n't even fund the majority of our country s creation . slave owners provided the slaves i guess . that s what your point ultimately boils down to you want to thank the slavers and not the people who actually worked and toiled . as always the hardest worker gets the least amount of credit and wealth . i understand the mutual benefit better than you do i m afraid . 3 they already have a historically low tax rate and also have a record high amount of wealth.they are n't creating jobs or enriching the country they re being desperately greedy and ruining the opportunity for others to move up . the economy as a result is stagnate and wages are at an all time low . how is that hard for you to understand . they make more than they ever have in history and pay less than they ever have in history so you re solution while the economy tanks and the middle class melds into the poor class so to cut taxes even more . trickle down has n't worked for 12 years why is it going to kick in now all of a sudden . 4 i agree cut spending start with defense/military/useless attempts at preventing gay marriage and all the pork . get money out of politics and maybe even close a military base or embassy . and yet i do n't expect to see a single conservative libertarian or flat tax enthusiast do a single thing to make any of those happen . instead i m bombarded by paul ryan s latest fairy tale in fixing our economy . not everyone can own a business this is fact . everyone currently ca n't move toward a rewarding career either . quite simply put we have too many people for too few openings . our current laws do nothing to promote advancements in technology nor the betterment of mankind . policies influenced by wealthy donors and lobbyists and an army of patent trolls all keep true competition and innovation out . flat tax wo n't fix it .
Jae_Siever	cjfvyvi	1407093810	. that s strange normally they need people year round . do you have a copy of the correspondence . or a name number . not that i think you re lying just that they ve wanted people for so long it s hard to believe they d turn anyone down .
Jae_Siever	cj7sp9i	1406322268	. we already have driverless cars that s the thing . it s an immediate issue that will replace non minimum wage paying jobs within a few years . secondly do not even try that flat tax crap with me . i ve actually looked at the research and read up on flat tax and the mathematics involved . flat tax is a massive scam and further give away to the 4 of the wealthiest of americans . it will shift the already comically low tax rate to the other 99.6 of americans . basically all the flat tax propaganda is just to eliminate things like the estate tax and capital gains tax while the middle class picks up the tab . we can scale down military abolish the nsa and close tax loop holes right now . but we have n't why do you expect it to happen later . because everyone pushing for flat tax like those things and wo n't want to see them go away . obama s a free market president and yet everyone hates him . he de-regulated the healthcare industry and i do n't see everyone calling him ronald reagan reincarnated . nor do i see his supporters attacking him for being a big business puppet . sheep all of them .

Jae_Siever	cjfw7q1	1407094375	. most of the jobs illegal immigrants hold would take an american over illegal . you might have to learn spanish in some cases but it s the same thing really . you just have to be willing to put up with low pay and bad working conditions . <URL> have at it .
Jae_Siever	cj709k8	1406248876	. well the heads of the epa were elected by george w bush so really the epa is run by people who do n't mind if the epa is poorly run . you yourself would probably agree its a poorly run government agency and so do i . our reasons may differ but bottom line is its whack yo . now what liberal and al gore have to do with global warming debates is pretty weak overall . why even bring them up . the environment is n't a political debate . personally i feel that reducing the amount of pollution that goes into the air and water is the fiscally responsible thing to do for two very simple reasons . better air and water quality lead to lower healthcare costs no politics behind this this is why we all do n't just scoop up water from sewers to drink . and reason number two is also water related . it costs tax payer money to run our water treatment plants . if someone wants to contaminate our water sources they sure as hell had better start paying a lot more to keep them clean otherwise they can stop exploiting our resources . the thing with global warming is whether it is true or false the solutions to reducing it actually have benefits aside the warming/cooling of our planet . we ll save more money and have healthier people .
Jae_Siever	cisshza	1404933103	. i ve always been fascinated with the labels people impose on themselves and others for simple likes and dislikes . in all honesty it seems like very few people are actually conservative and very few people are liberal . and for the extreme on each side they label anyone who disagrees with them the other what happens if a person is pro-choice and pro-gun .
Jae_Siever	ciak6ew	1403079317	. 87 people died under bush which is higher than the figures some other people have posted . more of our diplomats were killed outside of the embassy inside their own homes in the region or while traveling somewhere else . the exact number of actual americans killed in embassy related attacks is 20 . at least one that i can find his name was david foy march 2 2006 . karachi pakistan . suicide bomber attacks the u.s consulate killing four people including u.s diplomat david foy who was directly targeted by the attackers . i think quite a few lasted for hours perhaps even longer . it s hard to find exact times but we can see the actual events and imagine how long that would take . although we did n't launch a massive propaganda and fact finding witch-hunt because at the time anyone who tried was quickly hounded by the media and gop loyalists as being un-american and not supporting a president during war . examples below . september 12 2006 . damascus syria . four armed gunmen shouting <SPECIAL> <SPECIAL> storm the u.s embassy using grenades automatic weapons a car bomb and a truck bomb . four people are killed 13 are wounded . december 6 2004 . jeddah saudi arabia . al-qaida terrorists storm the u.s consulate and occupy the perimeter wall . nine people are killed . and karachi pakistan the place where david foy was assassinated was attacked three times in four years so i reckon to answer your question . this embassy attack lasted roughly four years without a proper response or investigation . no one has so much mentioned karachi pakistan or david foy so what else ya got skip . lay it on me .
Jae_Siever	ciaa8sx	1403050032	. the houses are normally fire damaged or have some sort of additional fees associated to them . property taxes are basically what they want you to pay for that s why they offer them up for a dollar . i ve heard those rumors too and in addition to those rumors some of the houses have already been hit and torn apart for said pipes or wiring . you d be buying the obligation to pay property taxes for a dollar basically .
Jae_Siever	ciwndd7	1405299504	. i do n't think that s a bad idea in low amounts . like give every adult 50 dollars a month in free food it should in theory grow the demand and since the products people are buying expire we ll have more activity overall . would n't be risky to try either for such a low amount of money in a test city .
Jae_Siever	citd0gv	1404981905	. interesting read and very different than what the average pro-fracker type lists . i ve heard some claim the chemicals are safe enough to drink and we have nothing to worry about . this may come across as an uneducated question but do these chemicals remain potent over time orr will they eventually mellow out and be relatively harmless .
Jae_Siever	cji64hw	1407293841	. let s try this again comparing nyc or ny in general to detroit is pretty laughable . detroit crumbled for several reasons and most of which do n't apply to ny i m pretty sure other cities in the country are in more dire situations . especially ones literally receiving foreign medical emergency aid or ones that take more than they give to the union .
Jae_Siever	cjxw5bu	1408748280	. the name itself is the main draw and it has a sort of extra security or insurance that other smaller banks do not have access to . since they were bailed out previously many people consider it safe . in other words it s been proven that no matter what bank of america does it will be bailed out and rescued by the government . smaller banks are not insured in the same way the larger banks are .
Valarauth	chxuh8t	1401773429	. big nra . seriously stop lumping your political agenda in with something that should be completely apolitical . if you want national and global stability and you do not want to see your country slowly lose its ability to produce food then c02 emissions need to be brought to a halt . not wanting to lose your job house and family from a natural disaster is something that everyone should agree with .
Valarauth	cgr6yfn	1397383049	. that is the fault of having a two party system in which one party is convinced that they can win by rallying a fundamentalist minority of voters furiously enough to abandon everyone else and another that stays just a little bit more inline with the views of everyone else . as demographics shift left and democrats slowly peddle back to center we are going to have close to a one party system for awhile . hopefully republicans will be forced to act to get voting reform that allows minority parties again and then we can have more than two parties .
Valarauth	cmaunxd	1416770926	. the other side of the coin is that art is at its core an idea and after you give that idea to the public it becomes theirs also . this is actually why the original only protected useful arts . anyone can own exclusive rights to their ideas and art for the duration of their life simply by not sharing it . the only exception to that is when someone has the same idea independently which really you should n't have any right over anyway . granting a legal protection to an artist was simply a means to encourage them to share their talent and thoughts with others and allow others to assimilate it . just because you do not like someone bastardizing a thought that you once had does not entitle you to prevent them from expressing it . this is not a black and white debate . the exact amount of time that the government should provide you with legal protections for sharing your song with the public is debatable . we could even argue that freely sharing or reproducing a song digital file or information is a form of speech if we wanted . some might even go so far as to say reproducing and sharing music that they have heard and relate to is a form of self expression .
Valarauth	cme8qvb	1417064973	. i am not justifying anything or advocating people putting themselves in that situation . i am saying that police need to get their act together and create protocols that reduce the amount of danger they are in or use less than lethal force . they knew what they were going into . the weapons that are wrongly used on protestors should be used in cases like this . even if what they did was the correct tactic this is why tazer guns and rubber bullets exist . they do not exist to shoot people that are not a threat .

Valarauth	cjsx5i1	1408304422	. secular government is incompatible with their world view . fundamentalist do not want a statue of jesus represented among a pantheon of deities and non-theistic monuments that equally represent varying belief systems and they do not want unbiased representation that does not promote their faith . everyone has a right to build a church worship read and teach their beliefs . they can build temples and clubs and dedicate their lives to prayer or whatever else they desire . that freedom is not diminished when people call to remove religious laws with things like the words thou shall have no gods before me from the halls of government . it is every bit as inappropriate as blasphemy and make no mistake it is to people of other religious views .

Valarauth	cl1r489	1412587676	. most of the gmo hate from the left has to do with the political aspects of gmo implementation too . patented seeds and genetic sequences pesticide usage concerns over proper regulation and other issues are often cited . i know there are also emotional appeals but those people really just want to know their food is safe and they know they have no way of understanding gmos enough to get that assurance . the republican party has also undermined many people s faith in the fda and regulatory agencies . as much as i dislike some of the emotional arguments against gmos their concerns are still much more rational than other fringe groups .

Valarauth	cftggv7	1393877465	. well if he pope hat is made from a blended fabric then i think we might have a case . this is religion we are talking about after all . just between the various types of christianity islam and judaism we could probably argue just about any ridiculous thing we want .
Valarauth	cmarfsr	1416764853	. just to add to your point 1980 s was/is a real problem but massive steps like dramatically reducing chlorofluorocarbons were taken to mitigate the most severe predictions 1990's-y2k this also was a potential economic threat and real work went into checking computer systems that prevented any real issue . it was also known to be a preventive measure against an unknown potential threat . it was more or less a better safe than sorry effort . governments did actually need to take some steps recommended by experts . the experts also told people not to worry and were not responsible for the panic .
Valarauth	ch1y9pg	1398452019	. i think what is getting knocked around here but nobody is saying is that many american schools are unwilling or incapable of objectively teaching christianity without either offending people or indoctrinating them . it is like trying to get the history of cell phones objectively taught by someone obsessed with the iphone to a group of children that are also obsessed with the iphone . it is just easier to mention the iphone in passing and focus on the stuff they know nothing about with your limited teaching time .
Valarauth	cl1z74h	1412613338	. racial groups and political groups are different . it is alright to criticize the political beliefs of a ideological group in a way that is not acceptable with racial groups . it is not inconsistent to say that people should not denounce white people based on the actions of some white people and vehemently denounce clan membership due to the actions of other members of the kkk . edit i just realized i am being trolled . there is no way someone is so stupid that they need to be explained the difference between criticizing certain beliefs and groups that support certain beliefs and condemning an entire city of people based on their skin tone . haha . this is different from what happens in this subreddit because of real self-consistent differences . it is the exact same reason that i am not claiming that your criticism of liberals on this subreddit is on par with criticizing that community . we share many common beliefs . they share physical proximity .

Valarauth	cgk4yyp	1396638694	. if you want justice then do not focus on the perpetrator . do what you can to help the victims . the idea of justice has been manipulated into a total farce . we should devote our efforts to ending and preventing pain not avenging it . reform the perpetrators when you can and take away their power to harm others when you can not . attempting anything else is like slapping the wind for causing a hurricane .
Valarauth	cfdb3sb	1392192594	. i am sure having vagrancy in your arrest record looks great on job applications . would you rather by in jail than homeless . i have spoken to some of the homeless in downtown orlando and was surprised by what they had to say . the shelters charge money to stay at for the night and have a ton of restrictions that make them undesirable to the homeless . sleeping under a covered walkway with a light overhead is way more desirable especially when there is no transportation required to beg for money in the morning . that means an extra money is made when people head to work and that they can afford to by breakfast and maybe lunch . they are also not allowed to use the restrooms unless they buy something so having a couple extra dollars means they can do that too . the problem is that people are more likely to give money to people that look homeless so being clean results in less money . another problem is that they want to be in high traffic areas with affluent people and that does n't go over so well . it also sucks that when there is no restroom available they still need to go somewhere and that is normally in an ally .
Valarauth	ceqybyk	1389870757	. i ve got nothing to hide is the biggest stawman argument of the century . the point of ensuring such rights has never been to protect the average joe with nothing to say and nobody to give a fuck when they actually manage to muster up a coherent thought . those rights are there to protect influential people that have ideas that can better society because they are a threat to the status quo and require protection . i am sorry but whenever i hear that argument it fills me with frustration . it just screams if i ever witnessed massive human rights violations then i would just keep my mouth shut and i am too much of a self-serving asshole to even consider why someone else would n't do the same . just bring on the police state because the country is exactly the same as it was two hundred years ago and it will be forever . that argument just shows a complete disregard for every great thinker in the history of our country and it is based solely around the idea that they are somehow better than people like mlk because they do not stir up trouble by thinking or acting in the aid of their fellow man .

Valarauth	cguyu3s	1397753927	. i agree that in a brick and mortal retail setting it would seem salesmanship matters but the cost saving automation is happening by making that sales model less cost effective . driverless cars are eventually going to drive costs down further and warehouse are using less and less people . i do n't see how a physical store is going to compete . laws could be passed to slow the process down but that is just going to hurt efficiency stop traffic from being decongested and slow the safety benefits that comes with the new technology . in the end nobody wants stores . they want goods . if you offset the loss of jobs with some form of economic change and replaced wal-mart with a park people would celebrate .

Valarauth	cetk1wh	1390158863	. i grew up in a poor ethnic neighborhood with an abusive father and was regularly attacked and harassed for being white on my way to school by kids that were the splitting image of the stereotype you are portraying but that culture did not exist on campus . it was a public montessori school that was zoned to improve integration and without it i would be a completely different person . we were given opportunities to succeed and i saw it work firsthand . i was rewarded for excelling at math . i was taught to play the piano and the clarinet despite my lack of talent . i was provided with free breakfasts and lunches . i was given speech lessons for an impairment i was lucky enough to have surgically fixed for free by a doctor when i had my tonsils removed thanks to a federal aid program that saved my life . i was loaned a computer by a school program and developed a passion for playing its educational games . now i make games for a living . the environment i grew up in was terrible but i was given an opportunity along with every other student in the school . all of those handouts add up and change lives . with that said it took me a long time to adapt and i am not denying that in some places it could take generations to transform a community . i am just saying that it does work .

Valarauth	cmaunxd	1416770926	. the other side of the coin is that art is at its core an idea and after you give that idea to the public it becomes theirs also . this is actually why the original only protected useful arts . anyone can own exclusive rights to their ideas and art for the duration of their life simply by not sharing it . the only exception to that is when someone has the same idea independently which really you should n't have any right over anyway . granting a legal protection to an artist was simply a means to encourage them to share their talent and thoughts with others and allow others to assimilate it . just because you do not like someone bastardizing a thought that you once had does not entitle you to prevent them from expressing it . this is not a black and white debate . the exact amount of time that the government should provide you with legal protections for sharing your song with the public is debatable . we could even argue that freely sharing or reproducing a song digital file or information is a form of speech if we wanted . some might even go so far as to say reproducing and sharing music that they have heard and relate to is a form of self expression .
Valarauth	ch1jz7y	1398408415	. i agree with strategic voting but there is also a place for telling your more aligned party that the difference between them and their opponent is negligible . for those that have been disenfranchised third party candidates are a way to show that you turn out to vote but that they need to actually earn your vote by being more than marginally different .

Indon_Dasani	cl1l7tj	1412565318	. oh i m sorry i misunderstood your point . the problem with your argument is that you re grouping the people i m talking about people of retirement age a majority of which would like to keep working and many of which have no retirement with everybody who does n't need to or ca n't work . including large portions of 21 million students . there are probably other reasons you do n't need or ca n't work a job but those are two big ones and not to mention how many of those are of retirement age simply is n't listed or frankly easy to calculate . also given that the survey was probably optional in the first place and considering that long-term unemployment tends to correlate with depression i wonder if selection bias might actually be a factor in that . even if that was n't a factor you re not only looking at a significant portion of the not-in-the-labor-force who are capable of working who want to work at least 10 of the ones who are n't in school or severely disabled there are still enough people being excluded from the unemployment numbers who say they want a job for the unemployment rate to be pushed up about four percent if they were included actually about the unemployment rate during the height of the last economic collapse . so to summarize your statistics do n't really talk about the people i m talking about but they do make the unemployment rate look woefully inaccurate as a measurement .

Indon_Dasani	cl1158g	1412523198	. gt eh . a discouraged worker who has n't tried to apply for a job in the past month i can see . i could see myself doing that if i got frustrated enough . but not even trying over an entire year that i have a harder time picturing . well at this point you d probably be looking at someone spiralling into depression or something . which is apparently a thing among the long-term unemployed . so there s that . failing at the same thing something you need to live for months on end is probably pretty soul-crushing . gt as you can see there was a really catastrophic loss in full time jobs between 2007 and 2009 but we ve actually recovered basically all of them by now . pretty sure that s not full-time jobs but total jobs . the payroll data double-dips on people with multiple jobs . that said it s actually pretty consistent with the census other than obviously being higher by about the number of people with multiple jobs . and as far as what you noted about the workforce the labor force has increased by about 1.5-2 million beyond the number of people with jobs which is actually higher by something like 5 million as of yesterday when i was digging around the data so that s a million or two additional unemployed just out of the people who are still looking . so yes unemployment is still higher by 1-2 million and there are an unknown number of people who basically gave the fuck up potentially in the millions and finally this is n't so much an economic recovery as it is part of the next economic cycle those jobs are going to all go away and probably a lot more the next time the economy collapses like it did in 2008 because ultimately nothing of importance has improved or been fixed since then . markets are not larger because aggregate consumer demand is not higher . american businesses are profiting more but they are n't paying more to their workers who drive the economy if anything they re paying less . there s still a tremendous amount more money being invested than there is stuff to invest it in so there s still huge pressure to produce economic bubbles and there s no shortage of candidates for what the next one will be about . our economy is n't dead yet sure but just because its lungs are filling up at the moment does n't mean it s gon na be able to keep breathing for long .
Indon_Dasani	cl9kp6m	1413324747	. gt ignoring the very clearly unbiased sources for those first two you ca n't really expect me to take a few very carefully chosen examples of bigotry and make the logical conclusion that all republicans and libertarians believe this . i m sure not all kkk members think black people are genetically inferior either . still accurate to call them bigots .
Indon_Dasani	cfy00d3	1394340331	. gt right i almost forgot it was the wealthy businessmen who ushered in the massive expansion of size power and scope of the federal government under wilson and fdr that lead us down this road . if you think the us government was n't corrupt until the progressives took over then you re pretty ignorant of history . because the progressive movement was in response to widespread government corruption and abuse of government power by the wealthy . you know military members beating union workers things like that .
Indon_Dasani	cfxyxvu	1394337274	. yeah but they have no constitutional grounds to do so . the existing size of the scotus was established through an act of congress precedent is against court packing and without that precedent there s actually nothing that says how many justices there are . is it possible for a government to crash due to a null pointer reference .
Indon_Dasani	cl37b19	1412717998	. gt libertarians constantly point out cases where we create a problem through bureaucracy make it worse by expanding the bureaucracy then figure adding more bureaucracy is the solution . i think you meant to say liberals . and the thing about that is when you re working with a law it s possible to make better or worse laws . to a libertarian whose only objective is to eliminate laws whose only political success criteria is to do nothing about a problem then trying to produce a better law will look like adding more bureaucracy every time . because if you have the ability to judge a law based on its results rather than its adherence to a political ideology you stop being a libertarian and probably become a liberal or similar instead .
Indon_Dasani	cj0mgmu	1405655558	. gt he s had all that time to come up with some way to revive his career . oh he wrote a book . he s clearly milking this as an opportunity to take the money of stupid religious people in his party who think of men who lose their office for believing stupid and false things as martyrs .
Indon_Dasani	chvqqsa	1401554700	. gt if only the founders were more specific . i suppose you think all the us founding fathers magically agreed on everything from the libertarians who had previously bankrupted america to the federalists who dragged them back to the drawing board to rewrite the us government and produce the constitution . that would allow you to imagine that the jeffersonian interpretation of the constitution was somehow relevant to a document that madison basically proposed .
Indon_Dasani	clv2i0d	1415308230	. gt just because the republican party is full of a bunch of psychopaths that clealry have no idea of reality does n't mean the democrats are a viable option . yes that s exactly what it means . you do n't want the delusional psychopaths in office . and if everyone fucking voted in the first place the psychopaths would n't be having a chance now . they would be relegated to a minority vote like they should be and their party would disintegrate . and after that then we could see a sane liberal party created to compete against the conservative democrats .
Indon_Dasani	cjvnpvq	1408552819	. gt if they are ineffective i feel it is up to our democratically elected representatives to add more protections . how do you know to elect somebody who will do that . i mean i can understand why you might not have a strong opinion about whistleblowing laws what with the fact that you do n't get to hear about the stories of people who employ them and if the whistleblowing actually accomplished anything or led to the release of information that is important for voters to hear . also i m getting a 404 on your first link is that meant to be a clever joke . gt i do n't fully trust either side to unilaterally set the balance . why should there be a balance between government openness and consequent accountability and the ability of government to conceal and thus become unaccountable . what has government secrecy outside of technical journals effectively equivalent to a firm s proprietary information done for us . concealed our constructing weapons that win wars . concealed our performance of imperialistic and unethical actions that the us population might not have stood for and that often bit us in the ass for our trouble such as this specific event where we gave nuclear secrets to iran . allowed for the concealment of outright literal crimes against our laws and the constitution . why should we balance anything to get more of that .
Indon_Dasani	cl6s0hm	1413060072	. gt so at what point are punishments severe enough to provide refuge for victims and a possibility of deterrence but not long enough to stifle reporting . i imagine the advocacy organizations would know that better than you or i or the republicans who asserted the measure against their opposition . and it d really just be a normal curve unless we re trying to maximize tax revenues from them . p .

Indon_Dasani	ch2yre3	1398561288	. gt there is a bible passage where jesus cursed a single fig tree to be forever without fruit because the tree did n't provide a fig while out of season . this part is serious to be fair i m pretty sure he was making a point at the time about expecting absurd things . of course that s not the view you take if you believe that all those parables were the literal magical word of god like santorum probably has to claim to avoid being lynched in some town hall in mississippi .
Indon_Dasani	cgl715g	1396755426	. after a few years or decades of this eventually conservatives will realize that they need to dog whistle each other in private because what they say can and will be used to find the true intent of their bullshit actions . so this sort of judgment is at best a temporary reprieve from racist bullshit .
Indon_Dasani	cm9ki3z	1416627409	. gt did he like make them fight in the military first or something . actually this is a standard legal way to get us citizenship no executive order needed . these soldiers are us soldiers on the books though . we have a low death count because the us military is very good at keeping people from dying of wounds . i m not aware of a count for people who get maimed in wartime but live through it but such a count would better reflect the price us servicemen pay .
Indon_Dasani	cltpdze	1415201697	. gt this would be the market speaking mister two wolves amp a sheep . you know what s funny . conservatives say they do n't hate voting as they pass laws and measures clearly designed to reduce voting . but then they turn around and keep saying stuff like this stuff that shows that part of their ideology is that they believe democracy is evil .
Indon_Dasani	clkguz2	1414354825	. i guess you do not believe in the existence of the epa . i ve never seen climate change denial quite that energetic before . gt the environmental protection agency calculates that each dollar invested in reducing carbon emissions also cuts other pollutants producing 7 of public health benefits . though admittedly not cited which is par for a paper newspaper though poor practice for the hyperlinkable internet .
Indon_Dasani	cl9idy4	1413320349	. gt i m not really sure what point you re trying to make . that maybe people who hold a political ideology vastly dominated by white males should ask themselves some serious questions as to why that s the case . and i do n't mean just republicans but yeah obviously them too .
Indon_Dasani	clp4eaw	1414761840	. gt umm people always need things like expensive hookers mansions and jet aircraft . that s the point of these donations . no it s not . donations for shit like that are actually not only obviously illegal but one of the few forms of lobbying corruption actively enforced . the most prominent legal form of donation is to a campaign fund which would get in trouble for hiring any hookers their spending is regulated .

Indon_Dasani	clk5cta	1414330751	. gt as i said laws democrats like should be passed laws republicans like should be trashed . and as i said most of the content of the laws republicans like is actually just trying to repeal laws democrats already passed . if you consider that equally proactive government for some absurd reason i do n't think there s going to be any productive discussion with you .
Indon_Dasani	cjq0j4a	1408024480	. gt what is it then . about using the police to suppress dissent and speech to imprison people for increasingly draconian crimes and in fact to reduce their rights . gt because the supreme court has been knocking constitutional enhancements to the rights of citizens when dealing with law enforcement out of the park one after another for the last 30 years i do n't know which 30 years of the supreme court you re talking about but it s not the one that waged the last few decades worth of the drug war and military-industrial complex .

Indon_Dasani	cfzmhct	1394513306	. gt you seem to imply that the main reason people do n't care is because they are manipulated . not so much that as the more people care about a political issue the more people will start to care about a political issue . snowball effects start small even in politics .
Indon_Dasani	cl36k4u	1412716592	. gt well given that there are lots of conservatives who solidly are the middle class i consider it unlikely that they somehow do n't have solidarity with themselves . you d think that but then they work against their own financial interests in favor of the financial interests of people who have magnitudes more wealth than they do .
Indon_Dasani	cliul5j	1414183404	. gt also why is everyone here just ganging up on republicans libertarians party i do n't like x calling them names . pretty lame . that s not a discussion . the discussion frankly happened years ago . fiscal conservative ideas are failures . reasonable people should not hold them anymore . the people still holding them at this point are probably all zealots and trying to convince them with even more arguments and evidence is going to be a waste of time . the voting thing krugman is talking about is a perfect example . there is no excuse for conservative voter restriction policies . anyone who adheres to them clearly demonstrates disdain for representative government in their pursuit of their political zealotry . there s no discussing with that there is only pointing and laughing and shaming them into quitting their reprehensible behavior .
Indon_Dasani	cfhk9cz	1392657224	. do n't worry the internet is here to help . exposing kids to ideas their parents did n't want them to hear since well probably when usenet was a thing . internet-raised generations have shown interesting political tendencies so far but thing s will get really interesting once they start to feel politically empowered .
Indon_Dasani	cjqc3s3	1408045834	. gt and sometimes criminals do n't want to be arrested and will use force to prevent this from happening . that s why police carry weapons with lethal force . this is the part . where you assume that the police mission has to involve maximizing the ability to kill . that lets the police murder people just so long as they tell you they were bad guys .
Indon_Dasani	cf6wsqv	1391537285	. gt it s not irrelevant to the conversation because it demonstrates that your claim was false . dude . the irrelevance is what makes it not demonstrate that . and rather than try to address that claim you just reassert the original claim . i m no longer convinced you re discussing in good faith . have a good day .
Indon_Dasani	clzq5b8	1415739956	. gt detroiter here yes detroit is a shithole but you can not blame a specific political party or ideology for this result . i sure as fuck can . watch . free trade and the corresponding collapse of the rust belt as businesses left the us to exploit near-slave labor in poor countries is almost certainly responsible for detroit s decay along with the decay of most of the rust belt . perhaps a runner-up for causes is the suburban living style whereby affluent people leave the city and stop funding its services while continuing to benefit from those services at their jobs .
Indon_Dasani	cl5zjo1	1412972198	. well not on the books . but the less a law gets enforced obviously the less relevant it becomes . and the anti-domestic-abuse organizations pushing for the law said they did n't want the measures the republicans added in so arguably it s not actually accidental . so at this point republicans really are just as shitty as they originally sounded though i could understand if you might have an issue about the wording regarding how shitty they are . we should promote accurate wording .
Indon_Dasani	cjvo6vy	1408553679	. gt as a member of the general public i think we should be the bigger person and take the initiative in not treating the police as enemies . we spent years doing that remember the war on terror and how much we fetishized cops along with soldiers and firemen . and they just got more aggressive and well-armed for our trouble . so no that s stupid it will and did demonstrably make the problem worse than mutual hostility will .

brieoncrackers	clpnqeq	1414803416	. while it s not common and rarely persists for more than a few decades in science there is often legitimate fundamental disagreement on political topics . government is a very complex beast and any statistics gathered about it will necessarily be as imprecise and inconclusive as or moreso than sociology studies . of course where science can definitively say whatever goals we have are best accomplished by whatever course of action our laws ought to direct us towards that course of action . that being said i do not think we know so much about governance right now to make obsolete a government not based solely on science and insofar as that is the case we have not made political parties obsolete though we have perhaps made anti-science platforms obsolete . so long as we are a republic so long as the populace votes for people to represent them and do more of the work of understanding legislation and its impacts because the general populace is too preoccupied with being a productive society to peruse every single solitary nuance of every piece of legislation ever proposed which affects their jurisdiction to be effective voters in a direct democracy so long as those things are the case political parties will remain useful tools for determining who best represents our interests and our concerns .

brieoncrackers	cj0dr05	1405635470	. depends on what definitions you use . i and many other self-identified atheists prefer the definition of atheism as one who does not believe and agnosticism as one who does not know meaning that someone can identify as an agnostic atheist i do not believe but i do not claim knowledge an agnostic theist i believe but i do not claim knowledge a gnostic atheist i do not believe and i claim knowledge or a gnostic theist i believe and i claim knowledge . i prefer this scheme for its precision but i recognize that others prefer the term atheism to refer only to what i would term gnostic atheists agnostic to refer only to what i would term agnostic atheists and theist to be a catchall term for belief with any state of knowledge . personally i do n't think the 3 term system what you seem to advocate best categorizes people based on their actions and their openness to being swayed . we do not wait until we claim knowledge to act and thus must consistently act on mere beliefs therefore the actions of an agnostic atheist will not differ significantly from a gnostic atheist as those of an agnostic theist will not differ significantly from a gnostic theist . on the other hand agnostic theists and atheists do not claim knowledge only belief and are therefore more open to arguments swaying one another though they may feel that the evidence they have is particularly solid and will require what seems to another to be an unreasonable amount of convincing . this is in opposition to gnostic theists and atheists which because they claim knowledge makes their communication often one-sided . i m not opposed to your naming convention mind you i just find it imprecise and prefer the one advocated in many atheist circles . as long as we all understand one another when we speak language is accomplishing its job and by extension so are the terms .
brieoncrackers	ckf44aw	1410413674	. what about the thou shalt have no other gods before me . thou shalt remember the sabbath day and keep it holy . over half of the commandments were religious in nature and therefore are in direct conflict with the first amendment of the constitution . furthermore nowhere in the 10 was any mention of the easiest moral question ever posed to mankind . it is not ok nor has it ever been to own people as slaves . the old and new testaments both got that wrong at least condoning it and occasionally commanding it . the bible no more influenced democratic ideals than oedipus rex . the ideals were a product of enlightenment thinking and human compassion and it is dishonest and vulgar to claim significant influence of the origin of the nation for such a morally repugnant religion . secularism was explicitly written into the supreme law of the land for a reason .
brieoncrackers	cllfa4p	1414439602	. so you would prefer corporations govern themselves . you would prefer the only roads be toll roads . you would prefer the only schools be private schools . there are a lot of ways each of us benefit from participating in a government . the wealthy benefit a lot from the existence of the justice system which protects them from robbery and theft and enforces contracts for them they benefit from the infrastructure of roads and they benefit from the pool of workers educated at government expense to read write calculate etc . they do business in the us because they get so much from the government for doing business here . and i do n't get what the point of government is if it s not to improve the lives of its citizens to accomplish together what we could not or would not alone . the wealthy do business in countries where these sorts of things are provided because it is a significant benefit . everyone wants these benefits . the wealthy get the greatest benefit out of it because they are then able to make multi billion dollar corporations entrepreneurs benefit from this because they are n't immediately put out of business by larger competitors workers benefit by having minimum protections from things like discrimination the unemployed of every stripe benefit from a safety net either allowing them time to get back on their feet or giving them the ability to survive without having to work while they can not be reasonably expected to work . the wealthy should pay proportionally more because they receive the greatest benefit from an effective government and they should pay more because if we had a flat percentage tax on everyone such that we had enough money to run an effective government we would starve the poorest working class citizens . it is better for the economy and the country if the wealthiest pay more .

telemachus_sneezed	cltodnr	1415199672	. i do n't believe in the classic propaganda peddled by public schools that the us functions as a democracy . its setup as a constitutional republic and its pretty much designed to limit how much control the voting public can exert upon the country . this country is really run by competing elite interest groups and they use the voting system as a form of gaming platform to exert their agendas . have you ever heard of the meme that the general public are not the customers of google but the product . its works the same way for american gov't . the voters are n't the franchise holders of the country they re just the pawns or the playing field . it enables a system with protections to keep one elite from directly attacking another elite s interests . but the elites get to pick who s potus by pre-selecting who can run . they directly influence who can get elected to the legislature . they determine who gets to be nominated and confirmed for the supreme court . the two party system is a sham designed to have the ants struggle between themselves . and they control this game by using their vast sums of money which they then direct the elected politicians to return those contributions back to the elites in the form of legislated pork . in theory the american voters can collectivize and pool their money and votes to pursue an agenda but in practice its too unwieldy to be truly effective . because it has to operate transparently it becomes easy to devise ways to head them off . the reality is the majority of americans are too stupid to figure out what is in their best interests and how to pursue it . elites hire advertising research firms to figure out how to manipulate specific populations of people to adopt a position and then they tell the media groups they own how to present it to their viewers . for example the elites were confronted with a problem that old white males fucked up america so bad they drove the voters to elect a black man as president . the system breaks down when only one lever democrats gets to pass legislation like pesky health care for everyone using rich people s tax dollars . so how did they fix it . koch amp friends pumped tons of money in 2010 to astroturf a movement called the tea party to energize angry white voters into emplacing a republican majority into office federal and state . then they proceeded to gerrymander voting districts with their new majority . then they got the supreme court they paid to put into their positions to remove that shackle that that was placed on them mccain/feingold with the citizen s united decision . it does n't matter that the gop are the old white voters party . when that faction loses its control over the party the elites will figure out a new scam to face off against the tweedledee democrats party . because the majority of voters 25 of the total population basically only listen to what the tv tells them to believe .

telemachus_sneezed	chwxr0w	1401683661	. i think you re confused . the medicaid expansion comes with a state exchange mandate . this is partially to offload the accounting and policing of the medicaid . you ca n't have the federal gov't run the exchange and provide medicaid expansion as the aca is written . to do this requires changing the law . unfortunately the pathetic opposition party is more concerned with their messaging than trying to improve the current aca regime . i am at a bit of a loss to understand why the federal gov't can not seem to get a more efficient and competitive exchange . states with small populations might be better off combining on the federal exchange forsaking their state health insurance regulation and that would give them the head count clout to get lower prices on the federal exchange . right now blue cross should be making a killing dictating the premiums of every policy on the federal exchange . if heathcare.gov could provide the data private insurers need they could probably offer a much more attractive plan than blue cross currently offers . also if i correctly understand it the 90 medicare subsidization to participating states lasts for only three years . waiting four years should be enough to collapse most state exchanges given how screwed up the congress currently is .

telemachus_sneezed	cejncix	1389114041	. gt libertarianism is n't viable because it prevents the government from helping anyone there are many viable governmental systems that has no doctrine that requires it to help anyone . gt and makes individuals fend for themselves in a free market system that offers them zero guarantees there is nothing unsustainable about that . that is how the us gov't operated before the 1870 s . government does not exist to provide insurance some form of guarantee . also individuals do not have zero recourse or no protection . that is the purpose of the judicial system to mediate wrongs which may have been committed between two parties . a libertarian would argue that monopolies exist because the government is used by businesses to create and maintain the monopoly . in a true free market if a monopoly is gouging too much profit from its customers that encourages other entrepreneurs to create a competing company . its gov't passing anti-free market laws that creates and maintains the monopoly . libertarians recognize that there is a role for gov't to conduct foreign policy and defend it with a military its just that it needs to be as minimal as possible and that it can not be used to interfere/regulate commerce . libertarians even recognize the right for the gov't to levy taxes in a form that does not regulate commerce . as long as its only for the military to fund foreign relations missions or other bureaucratic necessities . question to the libertarians in the audience why can you defend your own fucked up socioeconomic philosophy . gt those are contradictory . no they are not . you are confused . i am not a libertarian . but if i despise self-proclaimed libertarians for demonstrating total ignorance of the basic tenets of their philosophy i can not spare less contempt for someone arguing against libertarianism and having as much of a clue as the self-proclaimed idiots . the objection of minimally knowledgeable libertarians towards gov't is not towards legitimate functions raise a defensive militia enforce laws and contractual agreements etc . their objection is to any law or gov't agency which regulates commerce . that is interference with the free markets . example a libertarian would object to the existence of an fda pre-emptively preventing a company from selling a poisonous placebo to the free market . but a libertarian certainly supports a court system which will prosecute that company for the deaths they are responsible for by selling poison and misguiding its customers . whether a libertarian would agree to the legal system prosecuting a person for obvious fraud varies between libertarian philosophers . as for levying taxes to support legitimate gov't operations it varies among libertarian philosophers . the key requirement of any tax is that it does not affect free commerce . i believe a fixed personal tax is considered a legitimate means of levying revenue for gov't operations . libertarians are certainly against progressive taxation but i m not sure about a flat percentage income tax . i think a sales tax is also considered legitimate as long as it taxes all sales items not a specific sector . i m not sure about tariffs taxing services or property tax . gt no country can work under those conditions . many countries work under worse conditions i.e . dictatorship .

telemachus_sneezed	cko9lc3	1411287930	. gt i ve actually called my own insurer to ask why something was n't covered and the rookie rep on the phone actually explained that when the aca passed the company recategorized lots of previously covered drugs and lots were removed from their formulary . so whatever prohibition there is against that it s ineffective . no it means that you need to change out from your employer s coverage to the state/federal exchange or change jobs . drugs get recategorized all the time patented gt generic . its just a b.s . excuse for the health insurance company not to pay for drug prescriptions . on the other hand if you suffer from some obscure medical condition like cystic fibrosis there s not much you can do about it when a specific drug is critical for your good health . there is an aca board you can plead your case to when a health insurance company is denying coverage on a drug but you will need to be in a state that implements the aca . gt diagnostics are still expensive there s a medical practices board that will mandate certain testings as being redundant and unnecessary and therefore insurance companies can use the protocol to deny those unnecessary diagnostics tests . that s how money will be saved by avoiding unnecessary tests . actually there is a myriad of ways the aca will push costs down e.g . changing from fee for services to fee for outcome cracking down on er use as primary provider etc . but they do n't get implemented in states that do n't participate in the aca . gt is there any reason you think post-2030 era will be a meltdown other than increased longevity and stagnant population growth . it should be freaking obvious . gov't is going to pay for expanded medicaid coverage by driving down insurance costs . this was going to be accomplished by increasing the insured pools by mandating people pay for health insurance . insurance companies are receptive to this strategy because increased pool of available customers means they can better survive variations in payouts and thus lower their premium rates . but this can only happen when there are more young healthy people paying than old people over 45 who have increased probability of needing health insurance payouts . what happens after 2035 when social security has to payout for the baby boomers and there are only 2 workers subsidizing each retiree . the same situation exists for medicaid . believe it or not this problem is easily solved by driving down the most expensive health care system in the world usa payments down to the developed world s norm . basically if you live in the us you pay 2.5x more than the rest of the world pays for the same quality care . but the aca wo n't do enough mandatory rate cutting to match the efficiency of developed world s payment schedules . so the aca has two hurdles to meet . in two more years the federal gov't wo n't be mandated to cover 90 of a participating state s medicaid . if the republicans still control the house of reps its highly likely states will have to drop out of the increased medicaid coverage because they wo n't be able to afford to cover the federal gov'ts subsidy . it wo n't drop to 0 and revenue streams were created to help cover the federal subsidy but it could be expensive enough for states to revert their increased medicaid coverage for the poor . the second hurdle will be how well the aca will drive down health care costs before 2030 . it wo n't be a heck of a lot because most of the cost efficiency measures are relatively voluntary or limited in scope . politicians and analysts will re-evaluate after 5-10 years from now and discover the medicaid/medicare financing system will still collapse either in the 2040 s or slightly later . then a new health care initiative will need to be installed to head off the higher tax liabilities . but i believe the current private health care insurance system in this country will be dismantled for some form of single payer/universal coverage system .

Kastro187420	cistghu	1404934847	. i always wondered about this idea . is the measure of a good/productive congress based upon the number of new laws they can create in a term . we often say of politicians that you do n't gauge a politician by the number of new laws they propose and yet we assume differently when talking about congress as a whole .
Kastro187420	chslbo6	1401229102	. as i ve began to state in other replies here if you read the actual letter and not this opinionated garbage from raw story you ll note that they quoted everything except him wishing well on the family and expressing his sorrow towards their loss you ll see that he actually was quite compassionate . however he was also passionate about his constitutional rights .
Kastro187420	chjqg5f	1400267196	. welcome to politics where people promise one thing and then never do it once elected . this is why i do n't trust or defend politicians . the only thing they stand for is saying whatever it takes to get elected . once in there s no reason to hold true to those promises especially when they are in their final term and do n't need to be re-elected . i m not sure why these sorts of things are surprise to anyone . people always act like they were caught completely off guard when their politician of choice turns out to be like the rest of them .
Kastro187420	chq7eg3	1400962157	. what i m wondering is what happens if/when they just decide to ignore all the complaints and protests and say no . and do away with net neutrality anyway . i mean they do n't exactly have to listen to the complaints . they can just ignore them and do what they want anyway it seems like . what s the next step when they decide to ignore everyone as all indications are pointing that they re doing .

Kastro187420	cgv3v0e	1397763613	. sometimes laws need to be broken for the better of the country especially when government fails to do what is right . and once again i feel the need to point out that snowden did n't flee to russia . the us government stranded him there after revoking his passport and ability to fly . snowden was headed elsewhere . russia was just a transfer spot where he would get to another plane .
Kastro187420	chsli0i	1401229510	. gt a fading conservative political figure writes a public letter advancing his political agenda on the heels of a gun crime and you think he is as justified as the father of one of the victims for speaking out . i think he s justified in challenging the victim s father s opinion . i do n't believe that because he s going through a tragedy right now that his opinion is somehow immune from criticism . say what you will about his motivation for doing so but he s not wrong to challenge an opinion that he feels is incorrect just like the father has the right to challenge other opinions he disagrees with .
Kastro187420	cfnrmnd	1393281881	. i do n't think most people do either . the problem is the fbi has a history of of basically finding someone and providing them means money and material to carry out an attack talk with them and convince them to do it and then swoop in at the last moment and say tada we stopped the attack we funded and helped planned . real people who pose a real and serious threat . great take them off the street . someone who is upset who says he hates x person . do n't go out of your way wasting tax payer dollars to set them up and try to bust them .
Kastro187420	cjftepy	1407087984	. there s not much the police can do about a threat . if the guy had n't broken any laws the most the police could have done was tell him please stop . and they do n't exactly have an obligation to help you either . like i said before we do n't have all the details . all we really know is that the guy was in the process of retrieving a weapon . like i said to another guy how long would you have waited before trying to defend yourself . would you have allowed him to touch the gun . draw the gun . point the gun . fire the gun . at which step would you have decided to shoot him . in the heat of the moment it s not always quite so easy to analyze the situation and compare it to the text of a law and decide how to best to follow it . sometimes you just react to a threat .
Kastro187420	cj5qou8	1406143419	. if it were one single point sure . in this case when someone is as sam harris put it starting 10 fires in 10 minutes so to speak addressing all of those in the same amount of time it took them to bring it up is impossible . the only way to win is to simply deny them the fight in the first place . otherwise the congressman would probably still be arguing with the guy right now .
Kastro187420	cjfwfsa	1407094884	. i m sorry but your reasoning that in a potential life or death situation one is going to in the heat of the moment analyze the situation and try to make a decision that conforms to the letter of the law is just silly and unfounded . there are far too many emotions and other factors at play to suggest someone is going to sit there and take all that time to do so while another individual is going to retrieve a deadly weapon . the fact is this discussion is n't even about the firearm . the question is n't should he have had a gun on him . the question is should he have utilized deadly force regardless of the tool utilized to inflict it . in this case the tool utilized is irrelevant . the question remains was he justified within the context of the information we have to utilize deadly force . that s not a decision that we can really make given only what we know of in the article . i can speculate as to what i might do or you might do or someone else might do in a similar situation but without being in said situation ourselves we really ca n't sit there and say he was wrong . as the saying goes hindsight is always 20/20 . we have to look at it from the pov of the people involved not the pov of someone who read an article online .
Kastro187420	ch11vkf	1398366614	. gt demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of what free speech means do n't try to tell them that though it s a waste of time . trust me during that whole duck dynasty situation i tried explaining to people the concept of free speech . it goes in one ear and out there other . literally their only argument and defense of what is said is that technically it s legally allowed to be said . so that s what they ride on free speech arguments which are usually wrong .
Kastro187420	cfzod30	1394521296	. gt the difference is that i have a well-defined claim for my assumption that does n't change the fact that is indeed merely an assumption . an assumption with no credible facts to back up . what you have is a theory that lacks evidence . get the evidence then come back and show us .
Kastro187420	cigzy5a	1403729195	. gt it is designed to prevent an illegal purchase by punishing a person who tries to bypass the background check system . the purchasing for a criminal is only the extreme outcome of such a bypass . so you re basically arguing that the system is flawed then . as has been argued he wanted to transfer it to someone who did indeed go through a background check . there was no background check that got bypassed . in fact literally the only thing that would ve been different if the uncle had purchased it would ve been the price . besides ticking that one box everything they did was by the book . both passed background checks and were legally allowed to own a firearm . in other words the design of the systems is flawed . it catches perfectly innocent people trying to get a better deal on the firearm . it did n't catch a criminal it did n't help anyone . all it did was punish someone trying to help out a family member by saving them a little money . that being the case it should be obvious that the law and form needs to be re-written . gt similarly you are n't punished merely for crashing a car while drunk . you re punished for driving drunk which often but usually not leads to a car crash . because there is legitimate science to show that being inebriated leads to losing those critical reaction times necessary to safely operate the vehicle . the problem with your analogy however is that drunk driving laws do n't punish people who are not drinking and driving . you do n't see perfectly sober people being convicted of drunk driving when they are not . this clearly is n't the same as someone being punished for purchasing a firearm for another individual who went through all the same checks . a system designed to catch criminals and those who pose a threat to others should not also be capable of punishing and stripping away rights of those who do not meet those qualifications .
Kastro187420	cjktgpr	1407528116	. the issue is that the second amendment guarantees the right . having to jump through a bunch of hoops to exercise said right seems counter productive to actually having a right . you can argue whether or not it should be a right but as it stands now it is . requiring all these hoops and tests makes it seem less like a right and more of a privilege like a car . just my two cents on it .
Kastro187420	chsyy36	1401266016	. the problem is that there are too many factors that go into it . it s easy to give a broad and general idea such as more background checks or tighter regulation or ban xyz type of guns . but when you actually get into the nitty-gritty of hashing out exactly what that means it becomes quite complicated . do i have an example . i do n't . then again i m not the one calling for them . i would certainly be open to supporting something . however i m not going to support a broad and generalized push for something that nobody really knows what it means .
Kastro187420	cintqq1	1404417795	. gt why should the us accept those unnecessary deaths . because firearms are also used to protect individuals far more than they are used to kill them . there are various studies out there but some reports suggest an average of 40k dgus a year to an upwards of nearly a million . either way if we take even the lower end of the spectrum when it comes to defensive gun uses we find that quite often an individual will use a firearm to defend themselves . keep in mind defensive gun use does n't necessarily involve discharging the firearm . merely showing it to the suspect can be enough to scare them off . they re also widely unreported in the media because they do n't make good stories . i would say that the risk is worth it . the majority of deaths by firearm are suicide related . of the remaining a large portion are gang-on-gang violence or police shootings . death by firearm is generally a very broad statement . it includes suicides and justifiable homicides . in fact i would wager that if we solved the problems of gangs which are largely centered around drugs we could reduce the number of gun-related homicides by a large number .
Kastro187420	chn06jm	1400624052	. i know we re going to get into a semantics argument however insuring does n't necessary imply compensation . if we go by the typical definition car/home/flood insurance ect then we would be right in making that leap . however it also implies protecting people against the risk of intrusion in this case the same way that car insurance protects you against the risk of an accident you re not out thousands of dollars . it is true however that the two terms are not interchangeable . however depending on the context in which they are used and how they are used they can in fact be swapped out .
Kastro187420	cfjm4a5	1392849867	. well i think if you look at it from the point of view of say the day after tomorrow it sounds a bit silly . however if we look long-term there are problems that become likely . i do n't think anyone is suggesting that we re going to see massive destruction of land and hundreds of thousands killed in one shot but i do n't think we should dismiss acting on it simply because it does n't affect us at the moment .
Kastro187420	cfd5bnz	1392175637	. the problem is the average person does n't want news they want someone to reaffirm their opinions . that s why fox is willing to ignore facts and reality to cater to their viewers while msnbc is willing to ignore all other stories to jump on one that will attack republicans . ideally there would be a channel actually reporting current events and not just whatever drives their political desires at the time .

result in a bad outcome . i could leave the house but i might get hit by a car . i might get hit by a meteor . there might be a sinkhole in my front porch that i fall into . it s night time and the

on to the non-voting populace . you have said that you ca n't improve your circumstances by not voting . so if not voting is n't an option to change one s circumstances and voting can change one s circumstances how is one not being irresponsible by not voting . you re trying to hard to disagree with me that you re disagreeing with yourself . abstaining wo n't change anything . voting might make things worse . because there is no way to predict the future it is better to err on the side of caution and abstain . abstaining wo n't change anything . nothing changes . gt but i ve got a different theory . i think people like their representative and hate everyone else . because each candidate seems perpetually to run on a demagogic platform . we ca n't let that guy win he ll destroy the country . says both sides simultaneously . so we have a political rhetoric which views their political disagreements as admissions of guilt in a treason trial . see . they hate america . the founders would never have put up with this shit . you re right we should get those people out of office . i wish that there was some way to do that but if we did we risk replacing them with someone worse . i m just an ignorant voter who ca n't predict the future and is n't 100 informed on 100 of the issues 100 of the time so rather than risk it i ll just stay home . meanwhile those who do show up to vote choose who wins . congratulations your appeal to ignorance effectively depressed the vote . yay . gt and so it goes . we have a media which is tailoring the news to specific political ideations to ensure everyone hears the news that reinforces the world view that moderates are traitors to the cause and that if only those lazy stupid voters would just take 10 minutes to walk down to their local poling place we could solve all this gridlock . except that some poling places had literal 3 hour long lines to vote . florida estimates 22 of poling places had waits in excess of an hour . you re right rick scott s voter suppression campaign . it s a shame that he ll be governor of florida forever since his replacement might be worse . hell maybe charlie christ would have passed a law requiring all potential voters to set themselves on fire before they can vote . why stand in line for an hour just to make what could possibly prove to be a poor vote in retrospect . gt your profound

specific philosophy of pushing blame on to the non-voting populace . you know it s kind of a shame that you keep going after me . i understand that you re angry i understand that you hate me and i disgust you i understand that you so vehemently believe in your position that you are willing to attack a person that disagrees because i understand how you feel i really ca n't fault you or even get

OneYearSteakDay	cn1ktrw	1419195512	. gt what you re really seeing is the politician backtracking because he got in trouble with his funders . and why did the funders pull money from the campaign . because the candidate was losing votes he looks like less of a sure bet . why would i spend money on a campaign when candidate x just lost half his supporters . gt but when something is universally opposed by the voters and universally supported by the rich such as the tarp bailout the voters get the middle finger and then those same politicians usually get re-elected . tarp may have been unpopular but crashing the world economy was even less popular . i m not extremely fond of the troubled asset relief program either but it was substantially better than the alternative . but let s stick with the money versus people argument . if money trumps votes why is elizabeth warren a senator . why did the original version of dodd frank get passed in the first place . why did president obama let the bush tax cuts expire . why is bernie sanders starting his fifth term in office . why is rand paul holding his own for the republican presidential nomination . why did we see so many states vote for a raise in the minimum wage in 2014 . just about everything that i listed there is hated by big money interests . you re right that money has too much influence on politics and the american people have too little but those who choose not to vote give up a piece of what influence they do have . fight money in politics fight for a constitutional amendment overturning citizens united call your senator and congressmen in support of the disclose act volunteer for <URL> and vote in every election . gt i m implying that voting for a given politician does n't change what that politician will do if he is elected compared to what that politician would do if he won without your vote . that s why you vote for someone else . and get your friends to vote for someone else too . and volunteer . and donate . and canvas . and call . again unused votes do n't get tallied . if three people went to the polls and voted the candidate with two votes would win . if you do n't vote the candidate can not possibly lose your vote because your vote does n't exist . want to scare him . threaten to vote for his opposition . threaten to get involved and participate . you re a smart person how much could you add to the conversation . how many minds and opinions could you sway . want to see change . make them work to keep your vote make them fear losing your vote . if your vote does n't exist you ca n't do either .
OneYearSteakDay	ckhnkpg	1410661371	. not as much as i would like . in most cases the voting machine should give you a print-out that you can refer to if that does n't match then you need to take it to your voting booth dude . unfortunately anything that i can recommend would be after the fact . the absolute best solution would independent oversight one person at every polling place checking every machine to make sure that every vote reports correctly . that said even people who make polling machines have lobbyists that would oppose that what can one person do though . make a stink about it make your opinion heard inform others of your concerns and get them to get loud too . you might not be able to harvest the fruit yet but you can plant the seeds .

OneYearSteakDay	cn0xdx4	1419125297	. gt when you do n't know what you re voting for . no one thinks that they re uninformed . so everyone should vote all the time . i can agree with that statement . gt in this circumstance your vote has actually gone directly contrary to your interests and your vote has harmed yourself . you were better off not voting . you were better off not voting . so are you saying that people should retroactively not vote after their elected official does something contrary to their interests . you re implying that person should n't have voted because of information s/he could n't possibly have until after the election . gt how does not voting work towards one s best interest . gt it does n't you ca n't improve your circumstances by not voting but you can worsen your circumstance by voting . let s go back to the unhappy and fat analogy and do some transposition of your argument it does n't you ca n't improve your health by not exercising but you can worse your circumstances by exercising . your argument can be applied to damn near anything . i should n't leave the house i could get hit by a car . i should n't ask her out she could be an axe murder . i should n't get that vaccination it could make me autistic . gt i m arguing that in many cases it is not possible to determine the outcome of your vote . those cases do not justify abstaining from voting entirely . i could pick out a thousand examples of things going horribly wrong and use it to justify not doing anything at all but that would be self destructive and would almost certainly result in a bad outcome . i could leave the house but i might get hit by a car . i might get hit by a meteor . there might be a sinkhole in my front porch that i fall into . it s night time and the government could have genetically engineered vampiric monkeys . the store might not have triple fudge ice cream . i have no way of knowing what will happen when i step out my door so i ll stay home . gt when they have the means at their disposal to change it . you argue that blind ignorant voting is a means to change it i think you re part of the problem your specific philosophy of pushing blame on to the non-voting populace . you have said that you ca n't improve your circumstances by not voting . so if not voting is n't an option to change one s circumstances and voting can change one s circumstances how is one not being irresponsible by not voting . you re trying to hard to disagree with me that you re disagreeing with yourself . abstaining wo n't change anything . voting might make things worse . because there is no way to predict the future it is better to err on the side of caution and abstain . abstaining wo n't change anything . nothing changes . gt but i ve got a different theory . i think people like their representative and hate everyone else . because each candidate seems perpetually to run on a demagogic platform . we ca n't let that guy win he ll destroy the country . says both sides simultaneously . so we have a political rhetoric which views their political disagreements as admissions of guilt in a treason trial . see . they hate america . the founders would never have put up with this shit . you re right we should get those people out of office . i wish that there was some way to do that but if we did we risk replacing them with someone worse . i m just an ignorant voter who ca n't predict the future and is n't 100 informed on 100 of the issues 100 of the time so rather than risk it i ll just stay home . meanwhile those who do show up to vote choose who wins . congratulations your appeal to ignorance effectively depressed the vote . yay . gt and so it goes . we have a media which is tailoring the news to specific political ideations to ensure everyone hears the news that reinforces the world view that moderates are traitors to the cause and that if only those lazy stupid voters would just take 10 minutes to walk down to their local poling place we could solve all this gridlock . except that some poling places had literal 3 hour long lines to vote . florida estimates 22 of poling places had waits in excess of an hour . you re right rick scott s voter suppression campaign . it s a shame that he ll be governor of florida forever since his replacement might be worse . hell maybe charlie christ would have passed a law requiring all potential voters to set themselves on fire before they can vote . why stand in line for an hour just to make what could possibly prove to be a poor vote in retrospect . gt your profound <SPECIAL> gt your immediate disrespectful put-down of views gt further polarize individuals who do n't share your view to hate the speaker since he s being callously mocking gt i do genuinely hate you as a person you disgust me . gt so how about you take your self righteous smug attitude and shove it in a bowl of triple fudge ice cream gt your position is purely empowering ignorance . gt your specific philosophy of pushing blame on to the non-voting populace . you know it s kind of a shame that you keep going after me . i understand that you re angry i understand that you hate me and i disgust you i understand that you so vehemently believe in your position that you are willing to attack a person that disagrees because i understand how you feel i really ca n't fault you or even get angry at you . you ve made a lot of strong arguments and i enjoyed debating them with you . i would have liked to have had more and more in depth discussions with you in the future but since you have decided to go after me personally with such venom and vitriol i ca n't . you re like an otherwise wonderful woman who only talks shit about her friends and that sucks for both of us .
OneYearSteakDay	ckhmhkh	1410658731	. gt vote for who . both parties have proven utterly corrupt . representatives constantly break their promises and reverse stances ehem obama with no consequences . i think the opportunity for change came and went last week with the citizens united reform but that was predictably defeated by the majority of corrupt bastards . that was blocked by a filibuster in the senate almost every single republican senator voted against bringing that bill up for consideration every single democrat voted in favor . there are 33 senators up for reelection this midterm which means that if your state elects a pro-reform senator it could be enough to break the filibuster . also it was n't a majority that blocked it but a minority . the majority of the senate voted to open discussion on the matter but that is n't enough to win in the senate . the solution is n't to stop voting it s to start voting for the right people .
OneYearSteakDay	cknlb2u	1411222175	. see here s the problem with that logic not participating in the system does n't remove you from the system . if you do n't vote you will still be the subject of any laws that congress passes any spending they cut any wars they authorize . you sound like so many others that i ve heard from in these threads people who have been beaten so hard and so often that they do n't even see the point in crying out any more . the american people do n't deserve the shit we ve been putting up with and we need to get mad about it we need to get livid and loud . you need to turn that jaded disappointment into righteous anger and you need to do it soon . i can give you a thousand reasons to be angry and i can give you a thousand productive ways to express that anger but i ca n't make you feel that anger that s up to you . first you ve got to get mad my friend .
OneYearSteakDay	cknlm1x	1411223113	. dozenutz i ca n't be neutral . perhaps the wealthy and the super wealthy can weather the financial storm that accompanies republican leadership but i ca n't . asking for neutrality in current american politics is like asking for a neutral medical diagnosis well sir you could be having headaches because there s a low pressure system moving in or it could be because of the massive tumor pressing against your frontal lobe . there s just no way to be sure . we vote to better ourselves to better our neighbors and to strengthen our country and currently there is one party that is clearly making this country worse . i ca n't be neutral . the headaches are caused by a tumor and it s time to cut that tumor out .

OneYearSteakDay	ckvq6za	1412012994	. as far as i m aware no confidence does n't have much of a legal standing in the us . if 60 of people voted n.c . i imagine that the real human candidate with the most votes would still win . i absolutely admit that a vote of n.c would be symbolic but it would be a hell of a shock to the system for many politicians . not voting is a symbol saying i really do n't care . voting n.c is a symbol saying i care and you re all assholes and i vote and you the winner did n't get that vote . it s unfortunate that every state does n't have a no confidence and a none of the above option but that s what write in candidates are for .
OneYearSteakDay	cn0o0mn	1419104025	. that s true . and while i agree that the billionaire candidate has a better chance of winning than the poor candidate at the end of the day whoever gets the most votes wins . money in politics can not be an excuse to avoid voting money in politics must be the reason we vote . oh my candidate raised a quarter as much money as his opponent . that just means that it s four times more crucial for me to get to the polls in november . .

OneYearSteakDay	cn1dwew	1419182371	. you re not the first to note that . in fact i think that same argument was made when plato wrote the republic . so let s look at your argument a little bit more in depth you re saying that you re fine if uneducated voters abstain right . the problem is that uneducated voters don't abstain . you know who stays home . those who see the problems in the system and feel hopeless to change it do n't vote . those who see and understand that their district is gerrymandered do n't vote . those who see the money flowing into commercials and billboards and radio ads do n't vote . you re argument does n't work because the uneducated and uninformed will always stand in line to waste their vote . we tried keeping undesirables out of the voting booth with poll taxes and literacy tests . i guess we could always go back to that . or we could drown out the idiots with votes of our own . gt the real problem in democracy emerges from unfair voter laws which either disallow legitimate voters or allow illegitimate voters . election booth issues are also a pretty serious problem as miscallibrations lead to wrongly-filled out ballots . there were instances of voter intimidation in 2008 by the black panther party . these are the problems that are ruining our democracy and need to be addressed . turnout not so much . you re right that in person voter fraud has been known to occur . in fact out of 1,000,000,000 votes cast a total of 31 involved voter impersonation . . you re right about the black panther party . now let s look at proportionality that was two men standing outside of a single polling place . it was n't a massive organized effort with staged events in every polling place in every city in america . it was two assholes being assholes . now let s look at the fact that 160,000,000 americans decided not to participate in the november elections . statistics would suggest that half of those people are smarter than average right . that means 80,000,000 intelligent voters gave up their opportunity to influence their government . you want me to worry about a 0.0000031 rate of in person voter fraud and two assholes that stood outside a polling place six years ago but 80,000,000 americans giving up on their government not so much .

blackinthmiddle	ceifwit	1388982019	. i ve read it before and it s simply amazing . what i find most amazing is that in many societies laws/doctrines/dogma are set up that everyone involved realizes is bullshit but since the game has started no one wants to be the first to say ok guys . let s knock this shit off . we ve created a standard that absolutely none of us can follow . how many anti-marijuana champions have smoked weed . how many religious zealots are angered by women showing skin and punish them by raping them . how many anti-abortion nuts find themselves in the exact same bind that many have . the sex was great but now i m pregnant . got ta keep hating on the whores but am i a whore too . gay politicians who build careers fighting against gays and lesbians . the hypocrisy is stupid and we should all just admit it and end them . ah well i know i m being silly because these things will not happen . people would rather hide their shame then continue to wag the finger at someone else .
blackinthmiddle	cjtb17x	1408335289	. i find it shocking that with a video the officer that grounded and pounded that homeless black woman s face into hamburger meat still thinks the beating is justified . here it is in a nutshell . you give a cop a new toy then they re going to want to use it . who can they use it on with little fear of retribution . blacks and hispanics . you d be a fool to argue these points . the solution . either every cop needs to be forced to walk around with cameras that record all of the time or the citizens will have to start doing it . yes maybe it wo n't mean cops get thrown in jail . but at least the victim or the victim s family in the case of murder will win a civil judgement . sure it s tax payer money . but at some point you d figure budgets will get stretched to the point where someone will finally take notice . or you can go the other route . if i m a poor disenfranchised black man and i know the cops get their jollies from beating my ass and killing me maybe i should take a few of them down with me . i mean if you re going to kill me anyway maybe a different approach needs to be taken . i mean for that poor woman to get her face beaten in and for that cop not to be immediately arrested and thrown in jail . it says that there is no justice for blacks and a different approach may need to be taken .
blackinthmiddle	cn4dv71	1419445938	. no the public is sick and tired of the double standard . cops do things that the public simply ca n't . they shoot kill lie to cover it up and when their lies are brought to light nothing happens to them . it s not a matter of us vs them . it s a matter of no one being above the law . it s beyond obvious at this point that cops can literally get away with murder . look at the kid who was shot and killed in the hallway of his building . the cop who shot him first texted his union rep before even thinking about calling an ambulance . the man who was shot walked down a flight of steps and banged on a door for help . the person inside called the ambulance . it s actions like that that incense any thinking person . cops do brain dead things that you and i would be fired for on our jobs and often get rewarded for it with paid time off and early retirement with a pension paid for by the very people who they fucked over . make no mistake about it . it s not an issue of us vs them . it s an issue of making sure there are n't two types of justice . cops are public servants here to protect and serve the public . they re paid for by our tax dollars . as of lately cops are behaving like an occupying force . it s hard not to have disdain for them .
blackinthmiddle	cevzmg7	1390406271	. well they did become cops to uphold the law right . they re the ones that took the job to uphold the law . yes i get it . they squeal on their fellow cops and all kinds of shit happen to them . if i were in that position before i squealed i d have to get a ton of evidence so that even if i lost most job which i d probably want to at that point i d win a civil lawsuit . for example everyone knows that cops are instructed to stop black men in nyc under the unconstitutional stop and frisk bullshit . of course if you do n't have proof of this it s easy to dismiss your claims as you just being a whiner . well one cop was sickened by what he was told to do and made sure to record what his supervisors were telling him to do on multiple occasions . get evidence . get lots of evidence . get it on video . get it on audio . get it in writing . then go to lawyers who are privy to how the police system works but are not within the police system . you may want to go to the local news and give them a copy of your evidence . i d then upload my evidence to youtube . evidence has a way of disappearing . is this a lot of work . of course it is . but again the job of a cop is to uphold the law not collect a paycheck . we always praise cops for their difficult job . well this is one of those times where their jobs get difficult . they can either count down the number of days they have left until they collect their pension or they can do their job .

blackinthmiddle	cgmr8x3	1396918493	. i got my m.e . degree back in 96 . my second job out of college i was designing airplane test equipment . mainly it meant programming the machinery . i lost that job around 98 and saw how great the dot com wave was flowing and moved to straight programming . other than a three month unemployed stint in 02 i ve been doing that ever since . i feel extremely luck because both my wife and i work and we both make good money . what scares the hell out of me however is i have two daughters and my eldest will be approaching college shortly . she wants to do art or go to film school or something else . my youngest wants to be a singer she has a great voice . i could easily see myself spending 400k between the two of them for degrees that might very well be worthless . just think about it . just assume you have two kids and you have 100k saved up for them for college . if you stick that 100k in an index fund getting 10 over 40 years how much money do you have to make going to college to beat that person . with prices for college going to insane levels and with more and more people not finding work it s really hard to continue to justify it .
blackinthmiddle	ckxut40	1412200200	. gt i live in brooklyn and in a mostly white area there will not be stop and frisk activity going on near me since there is not much crime . really . i d love to be able to run the following experiment pick brownsville brooklyn and pick an affluent area and in both places stop 1,000 young men . in the crime-ridden area stop only blacks and hispanics . in the affluent area only stop whites . my guess is for example that you ll find more white people with marijuana ecstasy meth etc in their pockets than blacks . but like you said there s no stop and frisk activity in affluent areas so forget about reported crime statistics . of course the numbers are going to be skewed if you re only looking in one area . gt if i go into brownsville i will see two things many more black and hispanic people and much more crime . again read what i said above . if you re only looking in one place what the hell do you expect .

blackinthmiddle	ckfz0rv	1410490963	. as an american the only reason i can think that this has n't made bigger news is because it happened in a small town the guy did n't die and he got justice although who knows if he ll ever recover emotionally . as a black man i always remind my white friends that there are certain areas of the country that i would n't dream of living in . i need to live around intelligent people who do n't get a sick perverted pleasure from things like this . when you hear this stories you almost expect it to be 1 . texas 2 . florida 3 . louisiana 4 . mississippi 5 take your pic of some other southern state with a lot of dumb hick cops .
blackinthmiddle	cjq0p00	1408024854	. gt i like the horrific racist implication of this post that for some reason black people are not part of the rest of society you missed my message entirely so i ll explain . when i was a youngin 20 years ago the cops would fuck with me all the time . i d complain and complain but all i got in response from my white friends was a rolling of the eyes and a what did you do to cause this . i do n't know how old you are but there was a time when the word of a cop was believed unquestioningly . combine that with the fact that they only targeted black people and you had a lot of us spitting in the wind . so that s my point . we told you these motherfuckers were monsters and asked for support and we got none . now that they re fucking with everybody they re too damned powerful . have fun dealing with the monster that has grown out of hand .
blackinthmiddle	ckytrri	1412288866	. i think you missed the entire point of this article . of course it never happened to you . you live in iowa . they re not targeting you . i guarantee you that if two black guys with new jersey plates drive through iowa chances are good cops will pull them over for following too close to the line . the point is to go after people that will not fight the seizure because it s not worth it financially . if cops seize 8k from you and you live in new jersey think about it maybe 300 for a plane ticket 1,000 for a lawyer . 100 for a hotel stay time off from work . if you re a salaried employee it s lost vacation/personal days . if you get paid by the hour it s lost wages . oh sorry you did n't get the memo . your case has been postponed until next month . come back then . hopefully we wo n't have to postpone the case again . clearly if you re an out-of-towner you re only going to go through the trouble of fighting if a good deal of money was taken from you . they re not going to mess with you .

blackinthmiddle	ceg9ag7	1388752926	. well i think we can educate ourselves to some extent . what i mean by that is that the article says only half of us have stock of any kind . extra money in the stock market i could understand . people do n't have discretionary income to play in the market . but retirement income . 401 k . 403 b . even if you make 30k a year putting in 2k a year between ages 25 and 65 earning 10 interest gets you a little over a million dollars 1,064,222.13 before fees . this does n't even include any company match you may get . i m always stunned when i run into a coworker who makes as much as i do and does n't participate in the retirement plan . i ve had one co-worker tell me she probably would n't live that long and therefore was spending everything now . she ll probably live to 105 . and yes i understand if you make under a certain amount investing in your retirement account is a challenge . however since the money is tax-deferred a 2k difference amounts to about 110 more per month if you do n't invest . not to mention you re literally leaving money on the table if you have a company match .
blackinthmiddle	cil209u	1404155737	. you can take it a step further . basically the scotus s ruling today says a company does n't have to provide birth control if it goes against their religious beliefs . what about other things that offend . the bible does not believe in sex out of wedlock or divorce . what s next . we do n't believe in providing child care for a child out of wedlock . and what religions are allowed to do this . what happens if a business owned by a scientologist decides that something their employee does offends their religion . we can start getting really absurd here . why is a company obligated to do anything if it offends their religious beliefs .
blackinthmiddle	ch6fqzi	1398902664	. it s hard to get exact numbers especially if you re talking 2008 until now but wverything i m reading is saying rents are going up between 5-7 . i saw on nyc.gov that it went up around 7 from 2012 to 2013 . again this is nyc . in 2008 in nyc rents got really low because everyone lost their job and were moving back in with their parents . so if you re talking between 2008-2014 i can most definitely see a 20-30 jump . now i agree you ca n't just flippantly make that claim unless you have evidence to back it up . is it true . maybe . i d go so far as to say probably in some markets . but no sense making te claim if you do n't have actual proof or you re just guessing .
blackinthmiddle	cjpyffe	1408018473	. hell if police departments can afford all of this swat team like equipment they can afford lapel cameras . cut down on the former and increase the latter . i think most departments can get by on only one tank . you re right the citizens of this town and everywhere in the us for that matter should demand that the next elected official install lapel cameras on all cops and simply not vote for them if they do n't .

blackinthmiddle	cnahn2n	1420049341	. well let s start with the basics . considering there are now reports saying that just as eric garner said surprise surprise there was no evidence that he was even selling illegal cigarettes that day why not start with not fucking with people which is clearly what they were doing with eric . as a kid growing up in the bronx i ve seen many cops fuck with people this is nothing new . so let s start there . stop harassing people . stop using racial insults . you do that you ve already come a long long way . if the over-policing and outright harassing and bullying of cops stops eric garner does n't even happen . now let s turn our attention to actual cases where a cop should arrest someone . if you re arresting someone for speeding having a small amount of weed or some other bullshit low-level crime you do n't need to choke the person to death . are you seriously telling me that six cops could n't put garner under arrest without choking him out while another cop smashes his head into the pavement . you can most certainly tackle a guy without choking him to death . so to answer your question arrest those who need arresting without killing in the process . if you re policing a community literally to death do n't be surprised when you kill someone if the people have issues with that .
blackinthmiddle	cgo1cbp	1397050486	. gt but this is true for pretty much every politician . gt al gore is a perfect example and one that jumps to mind . he is ridiculously wealthy and has been a very vocal supporter of climate change . yet his home drew something like 220k kilowatt hours in 2006 . you re still not getting it . it s one thing to believe something . it s something entirely different to force your standards on me . you can believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman . you can believe that women should n't be allowed to have abortions . you can believe that homosexuality is an aberration . you can believe the president is a mongrel . but when you force that belief down my throat that s when i have a problem . so again i do n't care what a politician believes . when his or her beliefs are being force feed to the masses against their will and then you come to find out that they re circumventing these very standards problem .
blackinthmiddle	ckvqeu4	1412013408	. gt he s not going to jail even though he s been charged with aggravated assault and he had a deadly weapon . cops get charged all the time . charged conviction . i ll be honest with you i m actually shocked that he got charged . cops kill guys all the time with video evidence and do n't get charged . eric garner has six cops gang tackle him has an illegal choke hold put on him and dies and that cop is n't killed charged but this guy might get 20 years for grazing a guy on the hip . while i m thankful as all hell that finally cops are seeing some level of accountability i m just surprised that this case did it . and because he did n't kill the dude and will argue fear for his life i bet he does n't get convicted . i ll actually be shocked if he does . so just on the surface my thoughts are that this cop will not get convicted will then sue to get his job back and will also get his back pay .

blackinthmiddle	ceg9ag7	1388752926	. well i think we can educate ourselves to some extent . what i mean by that is that the article says only half of us have stock of any kind . extra money in the stock market i could understand . people do n't have discretionary income to play in the market . but retirement income . 401 k . 403 b . even if you make 30k a year putting in 2k a year between ages 25 and 65 earning 10 interest gets you a little over a million dollars 1,064,222.13 before fees . this does n't even include any company match you may get . i m always stunned when i run into a coworker who makes as much as i do and does n't participate in the retirement plan . i ve had one co-worker tell me she probably would n't live that long and therefore was spending everything now . she ll probably live to 105 . and yes i understand if you make under a certain amount investing in your retirement account is a challenge . however since the money is tax-deferred a 2k difference amounts to about 110 more per month if you do n't invest . not to mention you re literally leaving money on the table if you have a company match .

blackinthmiddle	cmpcqmu	1418092359	. wow i posted pretty much the exact same thing before reading your responses . you re 100 right . loggers have a way more dangerous job than cops . that does n't give them the right to kill first and ask questions later . a cop s job is to defuse situations . a cop s job is to find every reason to not kill someone . a cop s job is to only act when they ve identified a threat not before . a cop s job is to treat everyone in the same manner not just the hot white chick buying coffee from starbucks . do you want the job or not . i ll understand if you do n't . the pay in a lot of cases is not the greatest and the work is hard . again however just because those are the facts it does n't give you the right to shit on a black citizen s constitutional rights and treat them like pond scum .

DionyKH	cgu7urn	1397680686	. that s my argument though that you can sway the election in a popular vote by focusing only on metropolitan areas and ignoring rural ones . rural votes would mean absolutely nothing because there are n't enough of them to make a significant difference . does that mean that they deserve absolutely no representation . they have unique needs that wo n't make sense to people living in urban areas so they ll be overlooked . at least with the electoral college everyone s needs are represented at least by proxy . there are not enough rural folk to get their voice heard in a popular election . everyone s fooled by the consistent bullshit about cities only make up 20 of the population ignoring the fact that that s only if you count the people living in the city limits and ignore their fucking massive metropolitan areas .

DionyKH	cgu9f4x	1397683642	. the other person is n't there either . nobody is there to represent me because they re all chasing after votes in the cities where the election will be decided . my point is if you push a popular vote rural votes will mean no more than democratic votes in texas . rural people will have no representation at all in the presidential election and that s not fair because they represent a group with different needs than urban peoples .

DionyKH	ciol3ww	1404500109	. you do not fly the a-10 without complete air superiority . achieving air superiority is goal 1 for the us military p.s . we re really good at it too . why else would we have absurd weapons like the ac-130 . you ca n't fly that within 50 miles of an enemy aircraft lol but we have it anyways because our war doctrine dictates that first and foremost the united states air force controls the skies .
DionyKH	cgdaq27	1395933894	. i say this is bullshit . let me tell you a story reddit about what domestic violence is in a zero tolerance area . two brothers get in a fight at a bus stop . domestic violence . your neighbors hear you arguing too loud . domestic violence . i was charged with domestic violence when i was 13 because my geriatric step-mother tried lifting my mattress to find the cigarettes i had hidden there and i stepped on the mattress to prevent her from lifting it . she broke her wrist osteoporosis remember your calcium ladies i never touched her i was n't trying to hurt her and every witness to the fact said that except for her . i spent 18 months in that piece of shit dozier school for boys . you know the one on reddit every other week because they found all of those unreported graves of boys there . i spent a year and a half of my life in that shithole because of this bullshit and now i deserve to lose my gun rights because as well . domestic violence is one of those words that works like sexual harassment . it means whatever the person playing the victim wants it to mean . this is a gross miscarriage of justice to allow such a blanket broad term to be used to deny people of their constitutional rights . it s bad enough that all felons ca n't carry . that law was made in a time when being a felon meant you were a bad person . nowadays you can be a felon for improperly disposing of ammonia . this is erosion of our rights in process done by people who just ca n't put in the critical thinking to know better . they mean well and i get the intent of this ruling . really i do . but this wo n't end well .

DionyKH	cguguc6	1397699059	. i m not replying to all of your posts . lt lt the president appoints the people who interpret the laws and he decides which become law and which do n't . his influence could easily bring about ruin to rural america if he disregarded it as is likely to be the case . my argument is n't about republican versus democrat though i tend to see the former pay more attention to rural america . it s about the people in the cities which represent a tiny fraction of the land and culture in this country deciding amongst themselves who is best to represent the united states on the world stage . the things i brought up are examples of urban ignorance of rural life . i m aware that nobody here suggests that but idiots who have never been outside of their city very much do think like that and they would support candidates who did as well . while every voter would be equal the needs of the country would not be accurately represented because no voice that appealed to middle america would stand a chance in any of the major cities . why would a big-city star pander to the rurals and lose votes . he does n't have to he wo n't have to . so he wo n't . and forevermore middle america will lose it s voice in the world stage . it may not have the best things to say all of the time but it deserves a voice . that said you can reply if you want but i m tired of arguing this point . you people ca n't get past the simple 1+1=2 logic of hey everyone s vote just gets counted that s the best way right . and realize that when you do direct popular votes the will of the minority is crushed . that s okay now though right now that it s aging white guys who are a minority . there s no need to protect their minority interests .

DionyKH	cgu4ziu	1397675199	. they are n't . they re equally important and should be represented in a way that acknowledges that . a popular vote ignores every person that does n't live inside of a metropolis . the electoral college ignores everyone that is n't in a swing state . both of these systems are unacceptably broken but given the choice of the two i find that the electoral college creates a better microcosm of america s varying political stances than pulling all of our useful votes from the cities where the political climate is more one sided .
DionyKH	cgs8z4j	1397497576	. i would say that removing guns only changes what people use to hurt each other . guns are a great equalizer . if there were no guns the sinister would still prey upon the weak yet the weak would be absolutely powerless to stop them anymore . whereas if people have guns to defend themselves personal ability goes out the window . grandma is every bit as able to kill you as that 28 year old marine who just got home from deployment so skip over her house too when it comes time to loot . sure the criminals may have guns too but now everyone has the same amount of power .

DionyKH	cgdj21h	1395950121	. as far as i know suwannnee county fl sheriff s dept still operates under a zero tolerance domestic violence policy . if they re called one or both parties are going to be charged period . which was always my main problem with this . you re going to remove constitutional rights over something enforced on a zero-tolerance basis . absolutely absurd .
DionyKH	ch4cf96	1398711725	. i did n't see the speech but i can imagine hiring a speaker going wrong . imagine if the bush administration were represented by the views of colbert at that press dinner . we d be viewing him quite differently than we should . not saying that s the case here but it s a possibility that i m willing to entertain without proof to say otherwise .
DionyKH	cgsf8tw	1397509905	. if a poor person has a decent firearm chances are it s one of the most valuable things they own . and shelter or no . i can see situations for drawing the kind of line in the sand a gun represents . the group decide someone else needs my child s medication more than she does . well you can do that when you kill me . having a gun in a situation like that is like being a nuclear power in international politics . your voice ca n't be ignored and your rights ca n't be violated without someone paying the consequences . that keeps you safe . i do n't expect to horde my things but i will decide if i share them not you .
DionyKH	cgu6txp	1397678757	. it consists of the politicians ignoring them because they re more expensive to campaign to . if you do n't campaign there they do n't vote for you and thusly they re ignored when you re in office . but you re just too much of an idiot to see that right . the problem is you do n't mind a broken system as long as it favors your needs like a popular vote would .
DionyKH	cioykyh	1404541187	. because it s a part of health care in every other rational sense . employers provide health insurance and it is generally expected for women s health issues birth control among them because when it s all boiled down it s about hormone control something most women could stand to have are included in that . this would be similar to your employer giving you insurance that covered everything except compound fractures in the leg . you expect that to be covered and these women expect their health issues to be included as well . it may be perhaps unfair to the men who suffer from none of those issues but do white people get to whine because sickle-cell is covered .
DionyKH	cgrgjnf	1397416140	. it may be . perhaps a private organization should fill the gap and turn the profit waiting to be made there . i mean with obamacare now it s paid for either way is n't it if abortion is n't covered there i will happily join you in outrage . no pp does n't mean people ca n't get abortions . it makes it more difficult but this is skirting the problem people should be able to open these clinics same as any other clinic . if that were the case there d be no need to fund pp to provide access . that said i very much appreciate the birth control the missus gets each month from them .
DionyKH	cihmvsv	1403796272	. climate change driven by humans is as close as one can get to a fact . my question is what do individual measures really do . if i m driving a car that has a gas engine what does it matter the size of the car no emissions is obviously superior when a year of that difference is but a drop in the bucket compared to what commercial shipping puts out .

DionyKH	cgu77n7	1397679484	. finally at least one of you fuckwits can admit your agenda so we can have a rational conversation here . the problem with that is most of the resources and food come from that 20 . they do the work that makes the rest of it all possible . without them the entire thing comes apart so you have to see to their needs even if they re a minority . social bullshit . i m as annoyed as anyone with the republican party s social stances for the most part at least and i could easily do away with it . but until democrats acknowledge that their entire quaint little city way of life is built on the backs and work of rural america and acknowledge that with their voting . then there s no way this could work . people living in the cities do n't understand what goes into their life as long as there s gas in the pump and food at the store . pass a law to ban tractors because shit i do n't know anyone with a tractor and they re bad for the environment . really bad actually . why would n't you . it does n't occur to them that the law they just passed put a ten generation family farm out of business and bankrupted an entire town . why would it . why would they care even if it did occur to them . so those people do n't deserve adequate representation is what you re saying .
DionyKH	cgu7rl3	1397680519	. my reasoning for it being the better broken option is the 8 swing states represent different parts of america . rural parts metro parts northern southern west coast and east coast . cities and their metropolitan areas as would be focused on with no electoral college fail to represent one of these groups altogether rural folk . and being rural folk i find that unacceptable . you personally may not be represented by the electoral college but people who think similarly to you are people who have needs similar to your own are . the same can not be said of a popular vote that focuses on urban areas . the needs of urban areas would be seen to of course . every urban area would be seen to . each and every one of you would get tons of personal representation and proxy representation . know who is n't represented . rural folk . not personally not by proxy . nobody even gives a shit what they have to say because they are completely useless to the entire process now . they re extraneous .

DionyKH	cir6gn3	1404781969	. that was worded badly i realize now . i mean that both options should be present not in the same circumstance . one or the other . and honestly i do n't think it s fair to make a woman carry a child she does n't want to . i just find it equally unfair that a man has no say in the matter of whether or not his future child lives or dies if the mother chooses to exclude him from her decision making which is rather common from my admittedly anecdotal experience . i am not proposing a solution because i ca n't think of one that is right . i simply know that things as they are now are wrong . men should have reproductive rights that are in end effect the same as those granted to women . if they want the child they can keep it with no legal custody burden for the mother if she does n't want the kid and if they do n't and she does they can opt out of legal responsibility for the child . i do n't know how to make it happen i just know it needs to be worked on . the current system is broken it only serves the needs of one gender and any attempt to question or improve the situation is met with a severely aggressive response of her body her choice and the end of the civil discussion .
DionyKH	cgrgemn	1397415803	. i agreed that requiring permission may be absurd . but you think the people legally responsible for the health and well-being of that child should n't have access to their medical information . what if she did n't listen to the doctor and her parents feed her something that has a negative reaction with her medications for aftercare . she dies from the reaction . her parents have failed at the purpose for their existence because she wanted to keep a secret . the parents do n't deserve a say maybe in cases of the very young i m thinking 12 year olds and the like but they do deserve notification .
DionyKH	cjy7cne	1408780497	. they need training for maintenance not making excuses but i do know what they need the training for . what if it malfunctions . what if it shuts off unexpectedly . they need to know how to fix these sorts of things and the training gives them that .
DionyKH	cjkqukq	1407523324	. i am a felon who recently got his first job in 9 years . since starting i have noticed osha violations workplace hazards food safety issues and i have been worked an extra hour and a half almost every single shift . i am paid minimum wage i get one day a week off no benefits no vacation i m not even allowed to request days off trouble for taking sick days . there are n't always other options . it would take a lot to make me risk my current job in any way shape or form and it s a really shitty job .
DionyKH	cgud2mj	1397691176	. i agree it needs to change just not on the change . i was only being silly with the extra office bit . though imagine if the vice president were elected by rural america and had expanded responsibilities slightly expanded and specific to representing rural america while metro areas would elect the president . rural voters could opt to vote in the presidential election at the choice of forfeiting their vice presidential pick . pure popular vote for both .
DionyKH	cir61eo	1404781035	. you re right . that was an unfair statement for me to make . i honestly wo n't ever know and a woman very well could know what it s like to live with the mother of your biological child while she s pregnant knowing that at any time she could go off the deep end and ruin your life in many perfectly legal ways not limited to divorcing you or if you re not married just outright denying you access to your own child when it s born and taking away your custody taking your children out of the country or aborting the child in hormone-ridden confusion . women can totally experience that you re right .
DionyKH	cg6pcfb	1395255324	. and this is why i ll probably never make it far in the modern world . loyalty is too strong in me for one to just go bouncing around from job to job . i know my bosses wo n't reward loyalty anymore but that does n't make it any less important to me personally . i really hate this entire generation of greedy fucks who have ruined that for me . whichever group it was . whether it was the owners turning their backs on loyal workers or disloyal workers not giving them a chance to reward loyalty anymore whoever s responsible for this cut and run extort-your-way-to-a-higher-salary state of affairs can just choke on a dick . you ca n't just be a humble hard worker and get anywhere anymore .
DionyKH	cgu9cit	1397683501	. because not everyone lives in a city so what works for city folks does n't work for everyone . how hard is that to understand . the people in the city will vote with their interests in mind crushing out the needs of the minority rural population which are very different from the needs of metropolitan folks .
DionyKH	cgu7amc	1397679637	. is that just for cities or their urban areas as well . because that s the real point here and you know it . edited new york s metro area brings it s population up from 8.33 million to 19 million . la jumps from 3.8 to around 12 million .
DionyKH	cir51dd	1404778871	. just fuck off already you know we are n't going to agree lol . men deserve rights in the birth process my opinion on that is n't going to change because you get semantic about what a child is when . i m not against abortions . i do however feel that they need much stricter regulation along with more open access imagine that . i do n't however think a woman should have the right to kill her partner s future child without their permission and i likewise believe that a man should be able to sign a piece of paper saying that they opt out . medically abortion may not be opting out . socially except in rare cases that is what it is though . little girls make mistakes get pregnant realize a child can ruin your life and get rid of it . where is the little boy s option to get a second chance . you can hem and haw all day about it being a medical procedure and it is but those girls are opting out of parenthood in 75 of cases .
DionyKH	cguao8z	1397686123	. i do n't mind sharing my opinion on those questions have n't had a good talk on this in a while . gt what is a gun . anything that is not a weapon of mass destruction or classified military technology . it s my thinking that the government can put down isolated misuse of such items and the bigger guns the people have the more effective their massed use against a corrupt government would be . gt can you own extra-dangerous guns paraphrasing . yes i would say that you should be able to with a layer of scrutiny added . like we have now . did you know that 40mm grenade launchers are perfectly legal to own . if you have the appropriate tax stamps and licences . i would leave anything natively designed for automatic fire in that group requiring additional licensing but available to the public if they jump through hoops oy anything with explosive or incendiary ammunition . but i would n't outlaw anything short of wmd s as long as people are willing to jump through reasonable hoops to vet themselves for more dangerous things . gt can you build a drone and mount a weapon on it to kill people . if the law says it s legal for you to kill those people i do n't care how you do it . if it s illegal then we already have laws to legislate the negative behavior and we do n't need any more that would unduly burden otherwise law-abiding citizens . gt if you re mentally unwell the mentally incapable should be treated as children in this sort of situation . they have a right to the protection the second amendment offers but only through the proxy of whoever takes care of them . if they do n't have a caretaker it sounds so hypocritical but i ca n't rationally think of a reason why the mentally ill should be allowed access . that causes problems because it makes the inalienable alienable y'know . if you fail to pass basic safety tests under a mandatory education type of deal then you d have to keep trying until you got it right . no rights until pass mind you this would have to be a very basic safety test . like 4 cardinal rules simple . otherwise it might be infringing on rights even the first amendment has exceptions for direct public safety like this would be gun control in general i d call an indirect public safety issue . i have other more wild ideas like giving nonviolent felons their gun rights back did you know you can be a felon in washington state for throwing away ammonia improperly . .
DionyKH	cgne2pp	1396983924	. i have a question for you in regards to your statement about felons and firearms . do you know how easy it is to be a felon now versus when that law came into existence . when it was penned being a felon meant you were a very bad person . a burgular a rapist a robber or a murderer usually . today you can be charged with a felony in washington state for improperly disposing of ammonia . people who throw away their cleaning supplies in the wrong place should n't be allowed guns . my point is a felon is n't always what you think these days .
DionyKH	cgubgyl	1397687814	. it is n't overlooked . that 75 80 is represented by proxy in the swing states . their needs are still represented even if they personally are not directly represented in the college because they do n't live in a swing state . at least they get proxy representation . the same does not hold true in a popular vote . with 80 of the population in cities the needs of people in cities will dominate the election leaving the 20 in rural areas completely unrepresented . their viewpoint is n't considered by anyone not even any viewpoint close to theirs the proxy representation i was speaking of in the electoral college even if you do n't live in a swing state one of those swing states represents what you believe the president should be . no metropolitan area resident has any clue what a rural resident needs from their government and vice-versa . thusly both should have representation . 80 versus 20 in a popular vote is not representation it s being ignored by the cool kids .
DionyKH	cgdh4h2	1395946456	. thing with that is their screw-ups are because they fail at performing their job adequately not because their science is inexact like psychology . can you name one incontrovertible fact that ca n't be verified or even correlated with math . people s minds are not something to be tinkered about with and experimented upon . you do n't have a clue what you re doing you re just guessing and verifying your guesses against other people s guesses . none of you has any empirical proof of anything . not even any math that suggests empirical proof . tell me what s the process for identifying a fact in psychology . i m aware of how physicists do it with math . i d just like to know what amounts to proving something in that field .
DionyKH	cgdg8np	1395944765	. show me any hard numbers based on measurement instead of interpretation . what science is performed by psychologists . please describe what a psychologist does for me . do they take measurements with instruments . test those measurements against other experiments with math . no they do n't . they ask people how they feel and interpret their response .
Narian	cjalzc6	1406599181	. gt do you seriously need to see a written source for the idea that entry-level minimum wage jobs are not meant to be the end goal for the average person . yes because it s a social construct held up by trolls like you . provide the law that states this is the case oh wait you ca n't since it does n't exist . keep trollin brother you need the practice you re not very good at it .
Narian	cfczuar	1392163796	. gt gt religious philosophies make a very convenient means that people use to justify the ends gt but i am not aware of any evidence that evidence that shows that religious excuses are given more leeway than secular excuses . gt however i think it s clear that religion has no monopoly on causing good people to do evil . no one said it did .
Narian	cmbzghr	1416867173	. why are you afraid of having a discussion that stays on point . afraid your ignorance will show . if you re willing to accept failure then it s okay to be wrong sometimes . might want to grow up a bit and learn how to accomplish this task .
Narian	ciydfw7	1405457609	. ask about any political pundit out there most have been so wrong and off-the-mark yet they re not only still employed their opinion is still taken for granted . they re characters in a show and people are more interested in escapism than facing the harshness of reality thus characters like santelli o'reilly krauthammer matthews etc . are what we get . guys like nate silver more of a statistician than a pundit are who we should be focusing on and it s why we saw such a huge backlash against him the last few elections pundits do n't like it when people not only call them out on their idiot opinions but prove that their opinions are unfounded and horribly misguided with facts and stats .

Narian	ci59bg7	1402531732	. gt you can not decide that an 18 year old does not have the mental abilities to enter into a student loan contract but somehow can enter into a contract to purchase a car . again i specifically asked do you feel that the information given to post-high school 18 year olds is enough to make an educated assessment of the risk being taken through a student loan . i am not making a positive statement advocating for limiting 18 year olds from entering into contracts .
Narian	cfr76ve	1393619505	. gt and the fact that the girlfriend later let the police in may indicate he was if fact beating her . because the cops threatened to kidnap since there was no legal basis for taking the children away her children if she did n't comply with their request . just saying <SPECIAL> .
Narian	clypwn0	1415652627	. gt be specific what other time should he have used his spine . when thew gop was being little children and blocking the gitmo closing he should have grown a spine and got on the bully pulpit and berate/explain the gop intransigence to the american people . when the gop was threatening to shutdown the government . when the gop was blocking appointments . when factions within the gop were spouting that obama is n't an american he should have grown a spine . when joe wilson uttered those fucking hideous words you lie . twice in congress when obama was n't lying he should have grown a spine . he should have grown a spine when the gop started filibustering everything under the sun including their own bills in a partisan display of politiking . when the gop forced their way to lead the healthcare debate despite the fact they they did n't see a problem with such a horrendous healthcare system since it was working for them . he should have grown a spine after mcconnell stated that his single goal was to make obama a one-term president . not in order just some things off the top of my head .

Narian	cmt4mr6	1418416208	. gt thats a simple fact that i m not interested in debating . facts are usually backed up by peer-reviewed sources . there should be loads of meta-studies about the relative value of different mediums you could cite if you wanted but i guess since you said it it s a fact .
Narian	cmt4ev6	1418415815	. just because something is a published paper does n't mean it s more informative than a video . the institutional constraints put on academic papers are more likely to result in worthy submissions ie . peer review but it s dangerous to take these things as sacrosanct without asking why . if you can read and review a paper then you can do the same to a video . if a peer-reviewed paper is presented in video format would that reduce the worthiness of the information presented .

Narian	cjuvn3k	1408479223	. gt worden can be seen on the second video which has a better angle of the takedown adjusting the glove on his right hand before punching maher twice in the face . gt when maher raises his head slightly worden can be seen punching him at least once more before placing his knee on the back of maher s head while the other two officers handcuff him . gt maher was charged with assaulting a police officer and resisting arrest . arrested along with maher was a friend leonard hill . worden was one of four police officers who responded to the scene . gt the seven-page arrest warrant application submitted in july by lt lawrence curtis concluded that worden hit maher with punches that were neither necessary nor needed during the arrest . the warrant also alleged that worden fabricated evidence . gt hardy concluded that although worden s actions might violate police department rules they did not rise to the level of a criminal prosecution . so the officer struck an unarmed man who was pinned down multiple times lied about it covered it up with fake evidence made up fake charges and that s not reaching the level that warrants criminal prosecution . what does it take nowadays because killing an unarmed man does n't seem to do it so how evil do our police need to be before we even think about reining them in .
Narian	ci57yoa	1402528478	. gt that begs the question that 18 is old enough to vote smoke drive a car and enter into contracts because any change can not happen in isolation . i m asking specifically about student loans . gt gt do you feel we give enough guidance to post-high school citizens to make good work/career choices . gt yes as all that information is extremely available . it literally takes seconds to know this basic information . gt i just asked the intern walking by where she is from and what her siblings do . akron oh and elementary school teacher . bang three seconds later i am able to see on <URL> for free the average median and starting range of elementary teachers . how do you feel this is job/career guidance .
Narian	ci59bg7	1402531732	. gt you can not decide that an 18 year old does not have the mental abilities to enter into a student loan contract but somehow can enter into a contract to purchase a car . again i specifically asked do you feel that the information given to post-high school 18 year olds is enough to make an educated assessment of the risk being taken through a student loan . i am not making a positive statement advocating for limiting 18 year olds from entering into contracts .

Narian	clnjef7	1414615860	. gt so when democrats did wrong in the past i m surprised you did n't bring up the whigs in your attempt to form a coherent argument . southern democrats left the party for the gop because they were right-wing . right-wing politicians were the one perpetuating voter suppression and the like .

Narian	cjlqkqx	1407623995	. gt no and no . how can you talk about an issue with any authority if you do not know fundamental political science concepts that directly pertain to global climate change aside why are you using the anachronistic term global warming . at the very least you could look them up on wikipedia collective action problems . gt why do we need government to act first to solve global warming . well the first issue is that i did n't state we needed the government institution to fix the problem of global climate change . what i will state is that i feel the government is the best suited institution today to combat global climate change since it has the ability to engage in collective actions and utilize it s coercive nature to promote certain behavior . federal regulations about environmental issues ensures that no one can free-ride off the work of others and enjoy the benefits without doing the work necessary . telling someone to buy a prius if they are scared of climate change will not have an affect on the climate unless everyone or most people engage in the same activity . how is society to best coerce people into doing the same activity . there are multiple ways and this itself is a separate discussion/argument but one possibility could be to put in place federal regulations about vehicle efficiency would ensure that no matter who you were you would be contributing to the solution and would n't be free-riding on the efforts of others . sure we could also promote social morals such that people are personally motivated to buy more fuel efficient and less polluting vehicles but you return to the same problem of trying to influence a large group of people without letting anyone free-ride how do you best do it . i would argue that utilizing the government institution is convenient since it has a coercive aspect to it do this or we will punish you accordingly fines lawsuits charges etc . and this helps to limit the amount of free-riding . if car manufacturers do n't comply with regulations we can have punishments in place that will coerce these companies into complying and thus anyone who buys a vehicle will comply with the regulations will be included in the solution and will not free-ride . how do you feel the problem of global climate change should be addressed . what institution do you feel is best suited to promote certain goals and behaviors .
Narian	cmmass7	1417811399	. gt essentially the left voters need to be fellated to do their job . that s laughable . no they need actual left-leaning candidates the current crop of dems are centrist/right-center losers with no policy goals and nothing to offer . sure the gop is worse but the affects from a gop victory are diffused over the long-term and are thus thank to human psychology not seen as serious enough threats to get dem voters psyched up to vote .
DanGliesack	ciwb8n7	1405271598	. i m not trying to be a dick about it because i understand you re legitimately asking but my guess is just that you do n't understand the hobby lobby decision . the right granted in hobby lobby is extremely narrow and non-specific . it gives absolutely no precedence to employer rights over individual rights . here s the premise let s say the government s goal is to get me birth control . it can do this through avenue a and avenue b . the supreme court says that if avenues a and b are equally effective then the government must use a if it infringes less on the freedom of my employer . so in this case avenue a is having insurance companies pay for birth control while avenue b is forcing the employers to do so . obamacare allows for both of these things already and treats them as equally effective . that means if companies have even the most minuscule insignificant of religious rights then avenue b should be used . the question is n't corporate rights to religion vs . employee rights to birth control it s employee rights to birth control and corporate rights to religion vs employee rights to birth control and no corporate right to religion . that means even if corporate religious rights never ever take precedent over individual rights in any case in which they are at odds hobby lobby still wins their case .
DanGliesack	cekhxk7	1389198651	. realistically this is only going to be a problem if it affects his role as governor if he s forced to resign or something like that . people forget stuf pretty quickly . if he owns up to it and apologizes without much tangible consequence believe it or not this is not the type of stuff people really care about . if you re predisposed to dislike christie and looking for an excuse not to this is a fine one . but if you re just the average person genuinely trying to make up your mind about presidential candidates what s more important . that you like the person who you vote for . or that some city you ve never heard of in new jersey got a traffic jam one weekend . it seems like a big deal because it s politics and people are always prisoners of the moment . but if he escapes the short term this is n't a long term problem for him .
DanGliesack	cku1hp2	1411838544	. do you actually think they are n't working though . we pay mechanics to work on our cars right . what of the time is a mechanic actually staring into the car . what of the time is a surgeon actually practicing surgery or speaking with a patient . what of the time is a lawyer physically in the courtroom . what of the time is a salesman actually making sales . there s absolutely 0 part of being in session that relates to work being done . though physical votes take place in session everything substantial takes place outside it . even when the chambers are in session representatives do n't work in the chambers because there s nothing to be done there . it s the lowest form of argument to simply throw up numbers like you have . you are not paying your congressman to sit quietly and twiddle his or her thumbs in a room without computers or telephones . you presumably want that person to advocate for an agenda . that happens almost exclusively outside of session .
DanGliesack	cknswv1	1411241823	. what s wrong with that . is n't that at least more genuine . as romantic as people would like to be about everyone voting the reality is that if i m telling people to vote i only want the people who are voting like me to listen . why would i want people who are voting against my views to vote .
DanGliesack	cioi95l	1404493157	. that seems unlikely in this case . this plane does n't have unprecedented power or destructive force . most of the advances are considered defensive . the us already has the fleet and firepower to intervene essentially wherever it wants . the capabilities this plane is adding are all based on hypothetical future threats trying to close vulnerabilities that may pop up 10-20 years down the line .
DanGliesack	cj82332	1406343931	. i think your point is actually fair in that we do n't want to codify the idea of a corporation but it s worth pointing out that the drafters of the bill of rights very clearly imagined they were granting rights to corporation-like entities as well as individuals . freedom of religion was certainly meant to include churches and freedom of the press was certainly meant to include at the very least newspapers . the idea that the constitution is n't meant to cover corporate rights is a total farce it s completely necessary that corporate rights are protected .
DanGliesack	cep53pw	1389684404	. understand that in fed-land you are just seeing essentially the same spirited laws only with some precedent for how harshly they re going to be enforced . essentially the idea is that once you actually deal with this stuff off paper it becomes really impossible to distinguish whether a lobbyist that eats dinner in the cafeteria with so and so s chief aide is doing it out of friendship absolutely possible or self-interest absolutely possible . the issue is that almost nobody is an automated robot with easily distinguishable interests and motivations . a friendship might grow out of lobbying or a friend might end up lobbying you to do something . you end up far down a rabbit hole when you re trying to split hairs . and so ultimately the best policy for these things is legislating against them looking bad .
DanGliesack	ciptan0	1404654175	. that does n't really make sense . costs as a whole are rising so premiums will rise even without adding any coverage . it is a very complicated and controversial question whether birth control is truly free or not . if it is n't free though it s not much .
DanGliesack	cjx79t2	1408682135	. the big issue here was n't the dui it was that the da in question not only acted outrageously but also though hammered tried to use her position to get out of trouble . she yelled at the people who arrested them that they did n't know who she was and to call the chief of police and the sheriff to tell them that she was there . . she came in over 2 and went ballistic in the police station it was much more major an embarrassment than just a straightforward dui .
DanGliesack	chqfkrd	1400985113	. you re confused because most educated liberal pundits would acknowledge that both parties are not the same even if they view obama as a moderate . anyone who puts even minimal energy into learning about the government and its members can understand that there is in fact a spectrum with varying views and even though the members of the parties are n't as far away as they possibly could be on opposite ends of the spectrum the members of one party are typically on one side and the members of the other paty are typically on the other . it is tre that there are some issues where the parties seem to agree are at least where neither party has taken real action immigration nsa drug legalization but on other issues healthcare fiscal policy entitlement spending taxation the members of the parties do disagree even if both have to compromise to pass policy and there are varying views within the party .
DanGliesack	cfco6qa	1392139610	. well i think the jobs point is twofold more work actually does mean more jobs these people are paid hourly and there is more work meaning more ages are paid and more people are likely hired . you re right that these are temporary . the other important point is that if a pipeline is built it can lead to industry growth and industry growth will lead to jobs down the line even if those jobs are n't directly working on the pipeline .
DanGliesack	ciohmjd	1404491657	. what i said in layman s terms was a reasonable goal is what the court calls a compelling government interest . the court believes this qualifies as a compelling government interest but shows that it is unnecessarily burdensome because there is another way in which the us is already serving the interest which is less burdensome . assuming it is a compelling interest as opposed to ruling that it is one is just representative of the court avoiding legislation if a government passes a law it s not a high standard to prove a compelling interest . the requirement of a compelling interest being shown is more to define what is discussed in the next part of the test where the court can determine whether the defined interest is served in the least intrusive way .

DanGliesack	cjfujz0	1407090592	. well if for example clarence thomas was n't on the court you can bet your ass people would be saying old christian white men are controlling court decisions . the most likely next conservative appointee is a conservative female judge . she will almost surely make the same decisions the other conservatives are making it has nothing to do with her being a man or woman . it s about being conservative .
DanGliesack	cioev5u	1404484434	. holy shit this is misinformed . there is because of ginsberg s ridiculous dissent a dissent that so confused analysts that there is suspicion it was written in response to a different decision an enormous subsection of the liberal population seems to believe that the court chose between religious freedoms and contraception . the court does n't actually think that this decision will ultimately reduce availability of any birth control to women scalia says this in his decision . you and many others seem to think the hobby lobby case decided that the government can not force an employer to do something if it is against their religion . instead what the hobby lobby case decided is that the government can not force an employer to do something if it is against its religion and there is a less intrusive way for the government to fulfill its goal . in this case the government s goal is to make birth control available to all women . the supreme court agrees this is a reasonable goal . hobby lobby says this goes against our religious values . the supreme court decides hobby lobby is being sincere . the supreme court then says that if a government interest interferes with your religion that s just tough shit . you do n't get to opt out of the program just because you do n't like it . otherwise we would have people opting out of blood transfusions and all medical care and that s bad . but birth control specifically under the aca is one special case . why is it a special case . because the aca already provides an alternate way for women to get the same amount of birth control coverage without the employer having to provide it . the supreme court is choosing between option a everyone gets access to birth control and someone s religious rights get violated and option b everyone still gets access to birth control and no one s religious rights get violated . the choice is never between birth control and religious freedom if it was birth control would win .
DanGliesack	chqfp73	1400985475	. right i believe what he is referring to is that a 50-50 split in a democratic controlled senate is all but powerless in a way that is not true in the house . they have committee forming and agenda setting power but the body requires 60 votes to move a bill forward so a majority especially with an opposing president is meaningless . i do n't really like the what have you done argument though to be honest . the reality is that those in power must compromise to get things passed . bernie sanders voted for obamacare though i do n't think it would be his optimal bill . ultimately the two sides do have extremely different views on a lot of things and the fact that the republican-controlled senate could n't pas the dream act is inconsequential what s important is that the republicans for the most part do n't want to pass it while the democrats for the most part do .
DanGliesack	cjex7pi	1406994002	. it was n't the government can just provide it the court usually does n't legislate . it was that the government was already providing a workaround . the question in this case was not do hobby lobby employees get birth control coverage it was should a closely-held corporation get the same access to religious exemptions as a non-profit group . the government can not really argue whether the religious exemption is reasonable or not because they already have demonstrated through policy that it is reasonable . the case was simply about whether it was allowed under rfra to treat these closely held corporations and non-profit groups differently . the court said the government was not allowed to do this .
DanGliesack	ci2okul	1402283479	. there is something funky happening here . first it seems strange that the state did n't find anything . next you have a guy from ut-arlington with drastically different results and then the second scientist is listed as from pennsylvania and it s not clear whether that s supposed to be a school or just that he lives in pennsylvania .
DanGliesack	ci5ldh1	1402573535	. there was n't really any refusal to debate reid gets to set the agenda for the chamber and he is free to schedule as much debate as he wants . cloture just was n't evoked which means it will not be voted on . the no debate part of this is misleading .
DanGliesack	cesd0ao	1390007410	. why is everyone saying this . you do save some money by refining the oil here mostly in transport costs . it s not going to knock gas down a dollar per gallon but it will make gas cheaper here than it is in countries that need a lot of shipping .
DanGliesack	cj1z5lm	1405797854	. i m not totally sure what this sentence means to be honest but the point on giving credit is that it typically takes all pieces of the government to get something passed . you should give credit to obama and the ayes in the legislature for passing the bill . if a bill fails you should blame the person who held it up obama if it was held up by veto threat the nays if it was voted down in the legislature or the leadership if it was n't brought to a vote .
DanGliesack	cewbax6	1390430191	. i actually do n't think that s true . i have rarely heard advice that a 40,000 a year school is definitely better than an equal 10,000 a year school typically it s quality of student life facilities fit and etc . that i ve seen draw people to more expensive choices .
DanGliesack	ci1iag9	1402155108	. to pretend that results are all that matters is fooling yourself . if i say we should buy this boat and john says no we should n't and pete says no we should n't and i get outvoted you are saying your response would be to blame me when we need the boat because i supported buying it and broke my promise by getting outvoted by john and pete . it is not breaking a promise to vote for something that you support and get outvoted . it is also not breaking a promise to compromise in a way that makes gradual progress in a body where not everyone agrees with you .
DanGliesack	cesclen	1390006403	. then you do n't really understand the refining market . essentially all the money in energy is made upstream in crude extraction . refining is an extremely poor business to be in with razor thin margins and little to no profit . refineries in the northeast are literally worthless companies would rather walk away from them than operate them . when a refinery is purchased its value is often the value of the product on site . it s a really really delicate business whether or not that justifies propping it up is a different question .

DanGliesack	cixmo32	1405389059	. i think this is a pretty poor analysis of what the competing forces in the primary election were . people seem to forget this a lot but everyone and their brother thought that the major debate of 2008 was going to be the war . mccain was a longshot to get nominated but he was the only guy who supported the surge and then was the leader when the surge started to work . republicans nominated mccain because they thought that when he and obama debated on the war mccain was going to be a way better-sounding candidate . realistically he had way more experience he s an anti-torture former pow who dedicated his life service to sensible foreign policy . he was clearly the best foreign policy guy they had nominated . on the democratic side the clear refrain was thought to be that they were going to advocate ending the war and hillary really got killed by her vote for the war . it s not that obama was necessarily an early-adopter it s just that hillary s hands were tied on the war . obama could stand up and say this war was a tremendous mistake our foreign policy is awful we need to end it now . and he could point at republicans and hillary and say look who got you into this . once the general started and the economy tanked obviously the debate shifted a lot but during the primaries obama won because he had both the ability as an orator to speak passionately and he had the freedom as a post-war vote member of congress to speak passionately on the topic that everyone thought would decide the election . you re totally right that once the generals started and the economy crashed the war got put almost completely in the rear-view mirror . but obama s beating clinton was because he could take that strong passionate view on the war and it s not necessarily that clinton was more measured she just couldn't do so non-hypocritically .
DanGliesack	cfc7s98	1392085238	. realistically it s the same as it was with the republicans on women . you do n't ultimately win constituencies by running people who are like them you win constituencies with people who support policies favorable to them . romney won the religious right because his politics aligned with their politics . obama s did not even though he was more christian .
DanGliesack	cfayqdp	1391964710	. well the point is that if it s your professor there are grades involved if it s your boss there are promotions or firings involved or etc . ultimately those people have power over those things and it is naive to think a sexual relationship will not even be a consideration in the vast majority of cases .
DanGliesack	cl75dlk	1413093425	. it s a sort of loophole there s much less peer reviewed research about illegal drugs because it s harder to do . you re not likely to see a study of whether pcp causes violence because it so obviously seems to and it would take a lot of groundwork to set up the study .
DanGliesack	cj1x5f8	1405792936	. just to hijack the top comment the obama administration has rolled back a lot of drug law enforcement . a few years ago a law was passed to seriously reduce sentences for historically black drugs which led to extremely racist sentencing . and he s set to release around 45,000 people who committed federal drug crimes from prison early . the major issue which limits obama s influence on the war on drugs is state law . obama can not pardon someone for a state crime that is the job of the state s governor . things like three-strikes laws are n't going to be fixed by executive action that will need to be done on a state-by-state basis . people are free to imply that obama has n't ended the drug war but he has done quite a bit to improve it .
DanGliesack	cjc007a	1406730034	. people do n't really get what inversion means . have you stopped to think why they call it inversion and not outsourcing or some word that more clearly implies a move . the reality is that companies have moved their hqs overseas for years and that does n't recuse them from tax on us profits . what they ve been doing lately is moving all their costs to the us so their sales in say china are pure profit and their sales in the us are losing money . their us profits have been inverted . a way around this might be something like take of revenues from the us apply that to profits to determine taxable profit . but that might be unfair for companies who have been following the rules all along but have a disproportionately smaller margin in the us . the better way around this in my opinion is to just do away with corporate taxes altogether and raise the tax on dividends to the corporate tax rate . this would eliminate a lot of incentives that the government has created for businesses and might technically be a tax cut for dividend recipients but the existence of incentives does n't necessarily justify them as useful and the effective rate for dividend recipients will probably be somewhat consistent . it does n't totally make sense that the government taxes corporations with an income tax that s sort of the issue that s being run into here . it would make more sense to tax the owners of the corporations . then the states and cities can decide how they want to tax corporations to make sure they are paying for their use of local services .

DanGliesack	clz0kaj	1415672835	. this is actually the above poster s point she like obama is pushing for things . many have grown disheartened with obama because he is willing to compromise to get small victories . they perceive that as spineless while they interpret warren as strong . in reality they both are limited by cooperation of others .
DanGliesack	civfkxl	1405176805	. i m a moderate republican and i can explain the logic to your statements . one other poster has tried to do this but i do n't think s/he really understands the basis here . guns the point on guns is not about how much safer we d be if everyone has them . there are two big points . first the idea is that you have a right to arm yourself and protect yourself without relying on the government . the idea here is not necessarily that you will be safer it s that you are free to take responsibility for yourself if you choose to do so . now liberals may say but everyone would actually be safer if we just took everyone s guns away . everyone would be safer if we took many different freedoms away privacy is another great example of something that we would all be safer without . but americans are supposed to be guaranteed basic rights that would allow them to 1 take care of themselves without need to rely on the government and 2 revolt against the government if necessary . gay marriage it s actually your argument that does n't really make sense . marriage as you are speaking about it is completely controlled by the government . whether or not gay marriage is allowed the government controls who you marry . your argument is good if today s republicans legislated against being gay or passed anti-sodomy laws but that s not the case . that said while there is a legitimate and reasonable case against government sponsored gay marriage 9/10 people you meet who oppose gay marriage are completely unaware of it . an unfortunate reality is that a major part of the republican base right now is racist and/or homophobic . while not all are it s enough to get some policy control and it s the major thing holding back the party . welfare/tax breaks republicans tend to base their economic policy on incentives while democrats focus more on morality . a democrat will say we should give poor people more money while a republican will look at the same situation and say we should n't incentivize people to get or stay poor . in that case the democrat sounds more reasonable to me . but in the case that this thread is based on the republicans are actually more reasonable this 300 billion tax cut affects taxes for expanding businesses . that is businesses can only collect this if they are growing and likely hiring employees . this is n't going to benefit ge or monsanto it s going to primarily benefit mom and pop places that want to put in an extension or any company that is growing quickly . a democrat will look at the same thing and say why do the rich get money . and that as an argument seems far less productive to society . abortion if you ca n't see a republican s point of view on abortion you re not trying . those who are pro-life think it s murder . that is uncomplicated . imagine to a pro-lifer how those advocating for abortion must seem like cartoon villains .
DanGliesack	clma8m3	1414516001	. both those things are logical . access and quality are mutually exclusive . you can have great access with low quality vice versa or etc . conflating the two gets people into making illogical criticisms . your statement implies that there were countries which forced more government influence but were better at enforcing that influence equally across all people . those are two separate factors and they are both important . essentially there are two things here how much does healthcare cost in the us . a lot . is it good care . yes . you get into logical issues if you start to claim the quality of care is low simply because it is expensive .
DanGliesack	cilmps4	1404214214	. well except for the argument you would make against it it would have to be decided in court . anyways this is n't really an issue of the court . here the court is interpreting a relatively modern law . this is n't like the constitution which was written centuries ago and the court is trying to apply to now . this is a law from 25 years ago which is working as it was intended it s just a bad law . the court does not have the power to say bad law . and that s my big issue with the ginsberg argument .
DanGliesack	cesp9vu	1390058803	. the net income is absolutely awful when volume is considered it means that very slight changes in demand can put them in the red . ultimately the fact that it s not gross margin does n't mean you should just dismiss pre-tax earnings . capital expenditures are required to run the business as most of this is coming from depreciation acting like it s totally great to make 2 of the revenue you re doing is absurd .
DanGliesack	cj8ih81	1406400735	. gt barely 50 percent of detroiters pay their water bill . meanwhile up to two-thirds of city residents pay to keep their cable or satellite television service current . and 72 percent do the same to maintain their cellphones . that is not an opinion . it is from an op-ed but the numbers presented are just as valid as numbers presented anywhere else in the publication .
DanGliesack	ci4jnix	1402460786	. the idea is that even though it s called interest what you re really paying for is the rate of payment . it essentially discounts monthly payments on long term loans by forcing you to commit to all the interest upfront . if this did n't happen a long term loan would theoretically and in all likelihood be more expensive . this is n't the only type of loan that s available . but if you get a 20 year loan under this structure it should be cheaper than taking out a 20 year loan under a traditional structure .
DanGliesack	cefhxbi	1388676927	. really would be misplaying his hand . the move for snowden if he really wants to come back is going to be to hope that the republicans run a libertarian-leaning candidate in 2016 and then to come back a few months before the election . that s when public interest in political issues is at it s highest and there'a a big stage for the debate over him and his revelations to play out .
DanGliesack	ciptan0	1404654175	. that does n't really make sense . costs as a whole are rising so premiums will rise even without adding any coverage . it is a very complicated and controversial question whether birth control is truly free or not . if it is n't free though it s not much .
DanGliesack	cik1e7p	1404052436	. gt many people have an equally ill informed attitude about success . in their mind hard work bootstraps working smart setting up your life the right way infallibly leads to success just to be clear this looks like it s the premise of your statement and yet you do n't support it . instead it seems apparent that hard work bootstraps working smart and setting up your life the right way does usually lead to success . the point you are making instead is that doing all those things is not equally easy for everyone . people who have monetary advantages can do those things more easily than those they are advantaged over . that s your point here and so the ill-informed attitude is not the one above but rather that everyone is equally capable of doing those things .
DanGliesack	cjbzkcc	1406729046	. you ca n't have it both ways . when a person introduces or supports this bill they are taking a stand against corporate interests . corporations who practice inversion and want government contracts are less to support these people if these people are facing credible challengers . it is 100 true that people will often bring bills to the floor or at least propose bills that are populist and intended to make the other party look bad . but that is simply a tool to call to attention unpopular views of the opposing party . those who introduce and co-sponsor the bills are making a public stance of support just as you may be happy to support a congressman who does this a corporation which opposes this will react negatively to the congressmen in support . you are free to use cynicism and say these are the same and everyone is under the tab of corporations but general cynicism is the reason views of people like you hold no power . if you oppose corporate interests but you re unwilling to vote to support those who have pledged to support it because you believe in some conspiracy theory then your opinion is absolutely worthless to democratic governance .
DanGliesack	cfi4qoc	1392703850	. when i was cutting weight for sports i found fast food to be excellent for my diet . it tastes good was served quickly was cheap and most places have a ton of options which let me choose some healthy ones . most importantly though it was extremely consistent so i knew what i was getting in calories . if i had a chicken sandwich i could easily tell how much i was getting in protein in calories and that was n't true of my own food unless i carefully measured my stuff .
DanGliesack	clz0kaj	1415672835	. this is actually the above poster s point she like obama is pushing for things . many have grown disheartened with obama because he is willing to compromise to get small victories . they perceive that as spineless while they interpret warren as strong . in reality they both are limited by cooperation of others .
DanGliesack	cj1z5lm	1405797854	. i m not totally sure what this sentence means to be honest but the point on giving credit is that it typically takes all pieces of the government to get something passed . you should give credit to obama and the ayes in the legislature for passing the bill . if a bill fails you should blame the person who held it up obama if it was held up by veto threat the nays if it was voted down in the legislature or the leadership if it was n't brought to a vote .
DanGliesack	cfp9qna	1393433955	. gt he s a multi-millionaire i highly doubt he s worried about the resale value of his house . you are extremely extremely wrong about this . when you see that people are worth millions they do n't have millions sitting in the bank . it s all invested places . and one major place that these people invest it is in their homes .
DanGliesack	cfaym8x	1391964395	. that s probably a poor take on the issue . that s actually what rand paul is refuting with his monica lewinski claims he s saying the last president to have an affair in office was a democrat who disrespected his wife by cheating on her and treated his female employee as if she was there to be subservient to him . paul s entire point is that the democrats end up being hypocrites if they want to pigeon hole the republicans as being disrespectful of women . the issue for the republicans and women is that many republican policies end up screwing over women . cuts to entitlements hurt single mothers who are far more common than single fathers . pro choice women see abortion as a rights issue which makes pro life republicans seem like they are rejecting rights from women . the democrats are in the pocket of trial lawyers so they get to win the political battles over things like the lily ledbetter act . the republicans are in the pocket of the churches and even if both men and women care about accessibility to birth control it s women that are disproportionately affected by it . ultimately the republican issue on women is not that republicans are evil monsters it s that their policies disfavor women .
DanGliesack	cipfygu	1404602836	. no imposition happened here . the ruling actually says that the religious rights have to be respected only in the case that the government s interest is served equally well . in other words the government has the same ability to get birth control to the employees at hobby lobby post-decision as it did pre-decision . there is an alternative method to get them birth control and the existence of this alternative is what disallows the overruled route .
DanGliesack	ci3f68x	1402357828	. the ivy league schools are extremely accessible for all levels of income and only graduate students in heavy debt out of undergrad if they come from wealthy families that refuse to pay for their school . the issue is not good schools it is average and below average schools that are far more expensive than their academic peers .

Tasty_Yams	chzid10	1401936979	. there are dozens of sites that cater to conservatives . the comment section of almost any news source is dominated by them . the people who subscribe to reddit are the demographic that tend to be liberal . i get tired of people saying that we should force reddit to be more welcoming to conservative viewpoints . make your case . if you can draw reddit s demographic to it then you can . if not and you do n't want to get your politics from a site that skews liberal go to a conservative site . or you know at least do n't hang around a liberal site and complain it s not conservative . seems pretty simple .
Tasty_Yams	cefhoj2	1388676184	. gt republicans do not care about whether your health care costs go up or if an insurance company arbitrarily cancelled your plan . this has been the status quo for decades . the first proposal for universal health care in the us came over 100 years ago . the conservatives at the time i swear to god called it the prussian menace essentially socialism . when it appeared again in the late 30 s early 40 s republicans said it was taken directly from the constitution of the soviet union . in the 1960 s ronald reagan lead the campaign against lbj s medicare proposal warning americans that they would wake up to find themselves living in a totalitarian state if it passed . all of these claims were made with the financial backing of the existing for-profit medical establishment . stop me if any of this sounds familiar . you are correct . the combination of entrenched and highly profitable health care/health insurance money coupled with conservative red-menace/redistribution nonsense has kept the us in the position of the only advanced western nation to still not have universal health care . and of course we pay 2.5x what the average western country pays for the privilege . you were right except it s more than just decades . it s been a century .
Tasty_Yams	cggkqn8	1396286934	. it s the problem of capitalist for-profit insurance . if we had universal single payer coverage then everyone would be covered 100 of the time . but in a for-profit system you ca n't enroll in auto insurance the day after you have an accident . health insurance companies are not willing to let you sign up the day after your doctor tells you that you need a 100,000 operation . again there is an easy way around this universal health care .

Tasty_Yams	cf6t2p1	1391528696	. we should be clear that the washington examiner is not a newspaper in the traditional sense . it s an agenda-driven personal propaganda outlet for the viewpoint of a single person billionaire phillip anshutz . the examiner is printed up and given away for free . despite years of being published it has never to anyone s knowledge made a profit . mr anshutz foot s the bill . as politico reports the examiner is basically a megaphone for anshutz s right-wing views on taxes national security and president barack obama . a conservative christian anshutz is known for funding far right republicans anti-gay ballot measures creationist think tanks and school privatization groups . but he s probably become best known for his personal crusade against obamacare . mr anshutz s lead the revolt of billionaires and wealthy business owners to cut employees hours rather than contribute to their health insurance . in 2011 his primary business the regal theater chain had revenues of 2.8 billion and saw a 20 increase in the stock price . after handing out a six figure bonus to the board including almost a million dollar raise for the ceo he announced the theater would cut all their low wage workers back to under 30 hours to avoid paying for their health insurance .

Tasty_Yams	cemwks1	1389447614	. yeah as a liberal i d like to believe this . but in the last 6 months ive seen stories that conservatives are at an all time high and just a couple days ago more people identify as independent . edit coming back here to say after reading the comments below everyone is debating definitions . people keep saying that the definition has changed or that people are more liberal than they identify with . i agree . the real problem with all these polls is that they do n't define their terms but rather let people self-identify . it s all muddy for so many reasons . first americans are very badly educated about these definitions compared to most europeans and purposely so are we using the classical definition of liberalism . are we really looking at something more like democratic socialism . are we talking about neo-liberalism . and after 30 years of very purposeful pr campaigns from right wing think-tanks to demonize the word liberal how many people are willing to associate with a word that americans believe is synonymous with communist hippie etc . this edit has gotten out of hand sorry . but it seems to me the only way to fairly ask the question is to present basic beliefs and policies then let people place themselves on a scale of liberal to conservative .

moorhosj	cj1akeq	1405720577	. from your article gt collateral is a borrower s pledge of specific property to a lender to secure repayment of a loan . the collateral serves as protection for a lender against a borrower s default in the case of student loans we obviously do n't have a tangible object to serve as the collateral . so students pledge future earnings as a form of collateral . because of this the government has different rules than other lenders to guarantee their ability to collect . this includes all of the extra-ordinary ways they can take the students money tax refund offsets wage garnishment lowered benefits etc . this does not allow them to recoup some of the loss it allows them to recoup all of their loss . when you are the government taxes are not an iou they are future revenue . future revenue can be a form of collateral . if a business gets a loan on their accounts receivable would you consider that to be collateral . based on your prior comment it is just an iou . but yes you are correct that wage garnishment is not collateral . it takes the place of traditional collateral in student loans .
moorhosj	cfq122c	1393508001	. you make some excellent points . i think your worry about a gun registry is valid . it is hard to trust the government with even more of your information . this is a challenge of having states with different laws but open borders . a gun can come into chicago from indiana quite easily . as long as the laws are different across state lines it will be tough to regulate guns at all .

moorhosj	cksgz25	1411676431	. gt and your point about cost is moot here as voter id cards are free . is there free transportation to and from the facility . does the government cover the cost of other documents needed to get a voter id . gt all i asked is what is making these very very basic forms of id hard to obtain and suddenly i m against the most vulnerable members of society . and this has been explained multiple times in this thread both by people who have experienced it first hand and people who possess empathy . in fact the article you are commenting on is one example . to many people this puts undue burden on the poor s constitutional right to vote . in addition the problem it is claiming to solve has been proven to be largely a mirage . when you factor in that the people most likely to be burdened are historically democratic voters and the people implementing these laws are overwhelmingly republican the motive becomes pretty clear .
moorhosj	cihiw9t	1403786529	. this has nothing to do with the original point which is that money is the perfect way to address poor infrastructure and heavy debt . i understand the issue and the point . the government is the only entity willing and able to fix those 2 issues . who fills the pot holes in your town .
moorhosj	ckrft56	1411583376	. sure but america has a pretty low smoking rate compared to almost any country developed or not . this is because we viewed it as a health issue and changed our laws to accommodate federal and local taxes . today when the mayor of nyc proposes a tax on sugary drinks a main driver of obesity people are up in arms .

moorhosj	cj0wslm	1405693465	. you are completely missing the point . warren s argument is that banks are able to secure loans from the us central bank and near-zero interests rates . meanwhile students have to pay more than that and more than mortgage borrowers for example my student loans carry an interest rate of 6.8 and 7.9 . i also ca n't get rid of student loans through bankruptcy . that is the argument banks get lower rates and we bail them out when they fail . students pay higher rates and do n't get bailed out . far more nuance than your explanation .
moorhosj	chxdgvj	1401734505	. the utility of the rifle is completely out of place in the setting of a coffee shop . the assumption from myself would be that the person with the rifle had a specific reason for bringing it into the coffee shop . i can not know what that reason is but i do know that the us has high gun murder rates as far as developed countries are concerned . you claim that people s fears are unfounded but there is hard data that tells us that america is a violent place . living in a violent place i am wary of someone openly flaunting a violent weapon . this may not be the same way that you think but based on the responses in this thread it is safe to say that a number of other americans agree with me .
moorhosj	cj10fdi	1405700850	. you are 100 correct . the student will end up paying more for the 40k loan no doubt . however the fed government is only in control of one aspect of what the student pays the interest rate . they can unilaterally lower that rate and allow refinancing and provide relief to students . decreasing the cost from 40k to 20k requires far more entities and a significant timeline .
moorhosj	cks6k0r	1411656336	. i think adults being able to support themselves is more important than kids getting job experience . the average age of the people with these types of jobs is already at historical highs . in fast food the average age is 29 . this is probably because businesses can hire experienced adults for the same wage as inexperienced kids .
moorhosj	cj0y3wf	1405696291	. she knows what she is talking about she is simply making the populist argument . when banks failed taxpayers bailed them out and gave them access to cheap money . students do/did not have that option . if as a society we believe education is important there are clearly ways to make it more accessible . lowering the rate that students pay on their debt is one of those ways . comparing students to banks is just a simple way to present it to main street . she is making the case about national priorities .
moorhosj	cmckkxy	1416924535	. you seem to have very exact details of events you did n't witness . what you are doing is trying to justify the police/law enforcers killing and beating people because they may have broken the law . darren wilson got justice through a jury of peers so did zimmerman michael brown and trayvon did n't have that opportunity . the examples are perfectly selected the public was outraged in all three incidents . not because of the details of the cases but because of their own history of seeing and experiencing similar overreach . they feel like law enforcers act with impunity and these cases back that up .
moorhosj	cgz2e08	1398182629	. the us is the largest debtor nation in the history of the world but i suspect you knew the answer . we also have the most assets of any nation in the history of the world . you fog the issue by using absolute measurements . looking at public debt as a of gdp is a better measure because we are larger population gdp land than most of our competitors . if we look at that you will see that uk 90 canada 84 and germany 80 each have higher rates than the us 73 . yet each of those countries has seen their median incomes grow much faster than the us since 2000 . the rest of your comment was about nixon who has been out of office for 40 years . you need to find a new windmill to swing at .

moorhosj	ck2ypvy	1409246993	. pretty much how it works with the aca too . you give an estimate then the amount you owe or are refunded changes based on what actually happens . people who are self-employed do this all the time it helps them avoid having a giant tax bill at the end of the year . irs . if you are filing as a corporation you generally have to make estimated tax payments for your corporation if you expect it to owe tax of 500 or more when you file its return .

moorhosj	ckwwryw	1412114279	. i understand what the confederate flag means to some white southerners . i also understand that what it means is often non-offensive . however the act of taking it off the capitol building only to move it to a more visible location is completely insensitive . while that flag means something to those proud southerners it also means something to many black people with whom they share a country and history . i think in a way you can relate it to the redskins debate . people do n't necessarily mean harm but they are tacitly supporting it through the name/logo/flag . no doubt there is persistent and structural racism in chicago . the once affluent southside was carved up to make room for huge expressways . i would say that the voluntary segregation in columbia was worse as i live in chicago now . there were restaurants for black people and restaurants for white people they almost never mixed note this was 3-4 years ago . when hanging out in the five points area the tension was palpable . i saw over-aggressive police and prejudice students frequently . charleston is a wonderful place and columbia has its charm as well . they are just very different from chicago . you are correct chicago is more subtle and structural . in my opinion columbia was more direct and obvious . edit i appreciate your thoughtful reply .
moorhosj	cks6k0r	1411656336	. i think adults being able to support themselves is more important than kids getting job experience . the average age of the people with these types of jobs is already at historical highs . in fast food the average age is 29 . this is probably because businesses can hire experienced adults for the same wage as inexperienced kids .
moorhosj	ckv3uad	1411946554	. i think this statement makes the opposite point you intended . cars are very dangerous so we mandate a license written test aptitude test insurance registration etc . these same controls do n't exist on guns which are equally as dangerous as you claim . not to mention cars are used for transportation and violence is an unfortunate side effect . guns are made specifically for violence .
moorhosj	clp7dy0	1414768513	. and an even larger number of democrat districts not to mention how they overwhelmingly vote dem in statewide elections . it is the state most often used by the right to show how terrible dem policies are . yet they pay more in federal taxes than they receive with most of it going to the poorer southern states .
moorhosj	ch4gott	1398720212	. first the obvious cars are a form of transportation meant to move people from point a to point b . guns are a weapon meant to maim or kill via high speed projectile . you red herring of public versus private roads is laughable . what percentage of roads are private 1 5 . take a look at this . a couple highlights you missed in your analysis . cars require tag and title in order to be sold . in texas they also require that you report the sale to the department of motor vehicles a car registry . you can buy a car without a background check but the person who sold it is required to report the title change .

moorhosj	cmbysee	1416865990	. that is your personal bias showing up . i am talking more about studies that show how the law is enforced differently for black people and white people . these two studies give excellent reasons why black americans would distrust police . from aclu . from wsj . sentencing commission found .
moorhosj	ciujbyn	1405091944	. that is n't the point . the point is the hypocrisy of the post . you both claim to be for political discussion but turn into the same partisan blaming that you complain about . in reality we are all on the same team republican or democrat is just a way we choose to divide ourselves .
moorhosj	chcz79a	1399578087	. you are putting words in my mouth . i never said i knew the details only what the article said . i questioned your analogy because in one case someone said they received death threats so the media reported it in the other case the media never reported it . in your world that somehow shows a media bias against the nra . tinfoil hat land sounds like a sad scary place .
moorhosj	ck9zki7	1409933543	. one could also argue that forcing someone to stay on a ballot when they do not want to run for office is manipulation of elections . it seems as if kobach wants his name on the ballot to ensure the republican candidate wins . like you said it is a complicated issue but lets not pretend that only one side is playing politics .
MrFlesh	cjcbbla	1406750707	. gt their real motive is as you say more power . unfortunately he chose climate change of all things to make this point . when you look at how special interest groups operate their messaging how they argue and their facts that support their arguments it is pretty clear that the left has their ideological power players just like the right . with democrats selling out the country just as readily as republicans in an effort to join the 1 it s pretty clear neither side is operating because of altruistic reasons .

MrFlesh	cfdowrz	1392235723	. gt next you claimed the article was wrong . i said prove it we ve gone over this . the original comment i replied to did . the statistic this article is based on is so shoddy that it can immediately be picked apart by it s lack of parsing . which is why i brought up wage gap 4 in 1 and 6 in 1 because feminists did the exact same thing there . if the process at which those statistics is derived has been proven wrong the statistic itself has been debunked . gt you are saying it isnt men v women but somehow bosses either refuse to accept negotiation from women or you are saying women are bad at it which is it . the only person making a men vs women argument is you . in any work place the pay rate of two positions with the same time on the job can range between 10-20 and it comes down to how well you are negotiating . this does n't depend on any specific characteristic sex race etc . the work place is a capitalist not a socialist endevour if you do n't ask for it you wo n't get it . that includes leaving a place of work if a woman is paid less and she chooses to stay at that job being paid less that is on her .

MrFlesh	cjtrxwr	1408385917	. gt not to mention the fact that blacks are less likely than whites to use illegal drugs in the first place . i wonder why the arrest records and prison population does not reflect this statistic because black men abuse rape murder and steal far above their population representation . gt there are literally hundreds of studies and sources which demonstrate that this bias is institutionalized across our government and where did these studies come from . racial studies professionals i guess . are you aware of the term profit motive . do you understand that as an industry race studies is worth close to 4 billion dollars a year in the u.s you ca n't go to a single person in that industry for impartial information because as soon as they publicly admit race is n't an issue they are out of a paycheck . they have a 4 billion dollar a year reason to keep up the race baiting . as for each of your talking points they clearly come up with cause before even looking at the issue . suspension mostly black schools are in predominantly poor areas . poor areas create crime crime creates police presence and sensitivity to anti social behavior also the stat mentioned above begins before the black men are actually men it begins in highschool . and while it should n't happen people are people and your peers reflect their issues on you . this is the case for anyone . my educational experience was replete with younger brothers/sisters getting shit from teachers because an older brother or sister was a problem child . primary education funded mostly by state and local government taxes . bel air collects way more taxes than inglewood . no racism here . housing a study was done on housing in texas and found that out of 100 white people and 100 black people and 100 hispanics the black and hispanic people were shown on average half a house less than white people . which means half of all black people were shown the exact same number of houses as white people . additionally 68 of black people have credit problems which more than explains away this very slight difference higher education the study you are referencing was n't even pulled from real statistics it was pulled from fake applications . this is a common theme with racial and women studies . they create studies and surveys that confirm their bias . when real statistics are used their bs falls apart . in this case all number of factors could come into play . sorting software weeded out the bad applications colleges use the same software employers use and having set this software up myself there is no disclude darkies setting . it s harder to find an invalid john smith than it is a jamal johnson . it is also wholely dependent on the time the application was submitted . each college has a quota of minorities and women it must fill . to ensure enough spots for these quotas they are filled first and then the rest of the college is back filled with white students and nonprotected minorities asians and indians . so you can easily skew these results by simply waiting till close to the application dead line when you submit your fake apps . decades of oppression unfortunately this isnt true . 78 of black people live middle class and above life styles . of those that do n't there is only a 11 outlier of poor blacks over poor whites . by headcount of those two demographics poor whites are double that of poor blacks . it s hard to make claims of oppression when you can afford to send your kids to college . this sentiment is indoctrination and nothing makes a clearer indicator than modern technology . right now you are dressed in head to toe technology reading this on technology and technology that fed you breakfast/lunch that was created in whole or in part by slave labor . the average american is supported by about 26 slaves working for them heres a fun app that explains it all . this is why . you are the pot calling the kettle black . yet this never seems to register with those claiming oppression . black people feel oppressed because black people are told cradle to the grave they are oppressed by other black people and it creates a self fulfilling prophesy . this outlook is almost uniquely limited to american black people . you spend some times island hopping in the caribbean and you do n't see this division . there is not the room or the resources on the islands for the two groups to be at each others throat whatever happened in the past is left in the past for the future common good . of course every country has it s sjw crowd but by and large the caribbean islands are a model of racial harmony . you go to africa and ask the people why warlords are slaughtering them . they do n't say because colonization they attribute current events to current events . this is also reflected in extremely successful black people once they get out in the world and see other people and cultures the race war bullshit does n't hold up . morgan freeman eve arsenio hall zoe salander neil degrasse tyson to name a few have all said in there own words how they ve experienced racism when they experienced racism why they do n't inject racism into every instance they meet a challenge and why the solution is to not talk about racism . but instead of these people being used as guiding lights they become outliers and white washed now before you jump on the white people think racism does n't exist bandwagon . racism absolutely exists racist people use their professional positions to leverage their racism on others but that is far far far far different than you being required by law to sit at the back of the bus use a different water fountain or eat in the back room of a restaurant . and neither are minorities the only people subject to discrimination fat people short people ugly people disabled people stupid people poor people rich people everybody is discriminated against by everybody for every reason . your resume has between 250 and 400 data points on it and 90 of resumes are never touched by a human . want to know why it seems difficult for minorities specifically black people to get better paying jobs . 47 of black men drop out 48 of black men have a criminal record 67 of black people have bad credit any one of these three fucks you in the job market let alone more than one . another reason it appears black people is discriminated against is because racial studies and women studies use representative metrics as proof positive of discrimination . i.e . black people make up 18 of the population so why are not 18 of ceos black . but that is n't how shit works . nobody is guaranteed anything in life you only have chances of success . if you are going to parse by race which is nearly useless you need to look at each person as a chance for success not an automatic success . think of it like rolling the dice . this analogy isnt perfect but ive never found a better way to explain it the number you need to roll is dependent on your qualifications . if the mean roll for a success is 3 but people with bad credit need to roll a 4 for a success . it is going to heavily skew the numbers . so lets take 100 people sort them by racial representation . you have 82 white people and 18 black people . already out of the gate by sheer volume the white people have more chances to generate successes . now throw in bad credit and it looks like this 6 black people need to roll a 3 for success 12 black people need to roll a 4 for success 63 white people need to roll a 3 for success 19 white people need to roll a 4 for success this is a drastically an over simplified view but it demonstrates how quickly numbers become skewed without ever having to touch race . now go back to my 250-400 point resume statement . all those data points effect your chances of becoming employed and most of them are not going to qualify you better only establish you in the pack . a resume does far more to hurt your chances than to help your chances and all those data points come long before the question of race . and another point to consider is that women and minorities are a higher risk than white men . white men are not a protected group so have less opportunity to sue and there less political pressure to find the company at fault . this alone makes them a more attractive employee yet i highly doubt any major business seriously considers this . tl dr want to understand racial disparity take statistics and game theory not racial studies .

MrFlesh	ciylu0x	1405474563	. the reason why democrats do n't vote is because we have two right wing parties . liberalism died in politics a long time ago . a few loud mouths like warren are kept around to yell at the clouds and make it look like liberalism is alive and well .

MrFlesh	cg1scn5	1394736782	. gt yeah i do n't get this social programs are subsidizing substandard corporate wages argument at all . this is pretty straight forward . mcdonalds and wal mart give new hires the paper work and instructions on collecting benefits . they do this knowing their wages do n't pay at a living standard rate . gt are you really of the opinion that if the food stamp program medicaid and a whole host of other programs that low wage workers at companies like walmart rely upon were to suddenly vanish that walmart or any company for that matter would raise wages . no the programs would n't disappear but higher wages would make those employees ineligible . gt walmarts executives job is maximize profits they literally do not care if you work a 40 hour week and still can not afford rent/food/bills and really do n't care if when you get sick you can not get treatment or go bankrupt trying to pay for it so why as a society would we tolerate a business that operates that way .
MrFlesh	clbmsgz	1413506568	. the solution is two fold . fine the hiring company the amount of money that should have been paid to the illegals and was n't . if you make the cost of mexicans as high as running american workers they ll avoid the fines bad publicity and court dates and just hirer us citizen . lean on the originating countries of these immigrants militarily and politically . if more illegal hondurans live in the u.s than honduas do n't we have a political imperative to remove their tyrannical government that forces their citizens out of their country . seems like originating countries of illegal immigrants are pushing their citizens off their land so that the 1 of that country can seize it .

Thue	clt4jim	1415143225	. gt how long do you expect them to keep a certain party in power . 12 years . 16 . eventually they ll want an alternative which is why it sucks that the alternative can only be gop . but the gop has been partially in power since 2010 . they have had control of one out of three chambers of congress and very liberally used veto power in a second .
Thue	cm6x6yv	1416403374	. i still do n't know why republicans are called conservative . they do n't want to conserve anything . from wikipedia . the republicans have been throwing out all the traditional social customs . they are perfectly happy to politicize the supreme court and any other supposedly neutral institution . and to require a filibuster for every senate vote which used not to be the case . and to delegitimize the president .
Thue	cjnajyp	1407781782	. yeah but you do n't see states rejecting e.g . military bases tax exemptions or any form of federal pork helping the state because of their selfless concern for the federal budget . only helping poor people get healthcare seems to be selflessly rejected at the state level . pure spite on the backs of the poor .
Thue	ceq4ybd	1389796801	. i always hated build-in unspoken dismissiveness of the term conspiracy theories . sometimes it is perfectly reasonable to theorize about a conspiracy . theorizing about the reason for bridgegate is one such instance since we know there was a conspiracy . that does n't mean that there are n't obviously cooky conspiracy theories around like the global warming conspiracy theory . also how can anybody take christie seriously if he is too stupid to see that theorizing about the reason behind the bridge closure is perfectly reasonable . just because he fails at the most basic level to take responsibility for getting to the bottom of this it does n't give him the right to criticize others for doing his job .

Thue	cefr411	1388697814	. from the original article gt besides which so what . in 1979 the mean household income of the bottom 20 was 4,006 . by 2012 it was 11,490 . <SPECIAL> an increase of 186 . for the middle class the increase was 211 . for the top fifth <SPECIAL> 320 . the richer have outpaced the poorer in growing their incomes just as runners will outpace joggers who will in turn outpace walkers . but as james taylor might say the walking man walks . except that we are talking about percentages . it would be natural if everybody s income grew the same 186 which would make the dollar-increase for the rich much larger than for the poor . there is no reason why it would be natural for the poor s income to increase 186 and the rich s income to increase 320 . and why does n't he compare with the 1 s income rise which everybody else is talking about . ignore for a moment that the 186 are not inflation adjusted and therefore tell us nothing without context . it is at this point i wonder if the pulitzer-winning bret stephens is an idiot or a liar . i get the distinct feeling that he is trying to mislead the less numerate readers rather than lead or inform them .
Thue	cirppui	1404838880	. yeah but in most western european countries they rarely get into power . in much of europe they get elected in the minority because we have proportional representation . which is far more democratically representative than the election system you have in the us . so if 1/5 of the country is far-right 1/5 of the representatives will be far right . in the us more than half of the voters in e.g . a senatorial district have to far-right to elect a far-right representative . yet the republicans who are far-right have 40 seats in the senate . it is insane . almost all the republican governors have refused the free medicare expansion at great cost the poor to spite obama . such heartbreaking unmotivated cruelty just blows my mind how can anybody respect the republicans as a legitimate party .
Thue	cisf2ux	1404898579	. gt but has been the prolonged disaster of the aftermaths that has brought me around to thinking it would have been best left well alone . not to mention that the whole genocidal maniac was partly based on him still having chemical weapons which bush effectively lied about .

Thue	cirq72r	1404839786	. the us tax system actually has the insane . effect of making it more attractive for employees to get health care than to get the money in their paycheck and buy insurance on the market . the us tax system is stupid gt <SPECIAL> payments covering premiums for employer-sponsored health insurance are exempt from federal income and payroll taxes . any portion of premiums paid by the employee is typically excluded from taxable income and is therefore also tax-free although some employers require employees to pay their share of premiums out of after-tax income . the exclusion of premiums lowers most <SPECIAL> tax bills and thus reduces their after-tax cost of health insurance coverage . this effective tax subsidy is a major reason why most americans have health insurance coverage through either their own employer or that of a family member . .
Thue	cfekdy1	1392321617	. gt point is if someone says something about obamacare that looks like bullshit it probably is bullshit and it s generally very easy to verify . that is why it is so amazing that even prominent republicans in prominent situations obviously does n't bother to do even minimal factchecking . say the official republican state of the union response . just look at how paul ryan is somehow still relevant .
Thue	cjaevjq	1406584535	. gt because of the respect the court has given to religious beliefs and the fact that our our beliefs are based on best available knowledge we expect that our belief in the illegitimacy of <SPECIAL> mandated <SPECIAL> material is enough to exempt us and those who hold our beliefs from having to receive them the use of the word respect is definitely not a coincidence . the satanists are actually being unnecessarily reasonable by referring to science for their demands . according to the supreme court they could just have made stuff up .
Thue	chavc46	1399377925	. gt rep chaffetz says <SPECIAL> <SPECIAL> in libya after a <SPECIAL> you have to prioritize things . and what clearly <SPECIAL> happen is libya was not a priority . i believe what i heard is that <SPECIAL> because they wanted the appearance of normalization . <SPECIAL> what they wanted . and that fit with obama narrative moving <SPECIAL> but allocating less funds than requested means that some priorities somewhere will not be met . which i suppose is a plus for republicans because they can then use it as a scandal afterwards if it happens to go wrong .
DocQuanta	cj7sq4j	1406322315	. first whoever was in power would have to pass legislation to enact those discriminatory policies . this would be very public and cause massive outcry against them . second as written the amendment allows for reasonable limits and such restrictions you describe would be widely seen as unreasonable . that said i would agree that the first section needs some changes to make it explicit what is or is n't reasonable .
DocQuanta	ckj0fsd	1410800353	. when they say they want smaller government they mean they want less social welfare and less business regulations . on the other hand they are all for a massive military and want to use said military in repeated foreign wars and are just fine with legislating morality of individuals and instituting a police state to enforce said morality . their definition of smaller government is very selective .
DocQuanta	cj9apa5	1406485665	. not quite . you re forgetting that with ubi people wo n't need to work . if being unemployed is a viable alternative to being employed companies lose most of their leverage over their employees especially the low income ones . a company will have to pay a worker enough so that the luxuries he d lose from quitting outweigh the burden of continuing to work for the company .

DocQuanta	chlulw3	1400516881	. the aca is similar to a plan first put forth by nixon . it is more directly based off the heritage foundation s plan put forth as an alternative to the plan put forth by the clinton s and is very much like the plan implemented in massachusetts by gov . romney . the reason republicans opposed it is simply because the democrats decided to implement it . it has nothing to do with policy and everything to do with politics .
DocQuanta	cj7vfwf	1406327895	. easy most people blame the other party for the problems in congress . you probably have a congressman of your own party so he/she is n't part of the problem . if you do n't have a congressman of your own party you re probably one of the 36 in this poll .
DocQuanta	cgcrxjk	1395873934	. oh he d do much better than kucinich . sanders in addition to being a senator does n't come off as slightly ridiculous like kucinich . unless someone else to clinton s left runs who is a better candidate sanders would be clinton s biggest rival . biden and schweizer are about even with clinton in terms of politics . there really is n't a reason to support either over clinton . sanders is significantly different from her so will draw much more support from those not predisposed to support clinton .
DocQuanta	cgncbsr	1396980558	. the problem is in high unemployment areas there are going to be many more people looking for work than there is work available . but that s just one issue . another is that having a population of people desperate for work puts downward pressure on wages and work conditions . you do n't want people to be in a position of knowing that however bad their job is being unemployed is worse . finally desperation leads many bad social issues . depression and suicide crime apathy social unrest . bad things begin to happen when you have a large population of people who are in dire straights .
DocQuanta	ck1wfly	1409152865	. the feds do n't have the power to enforce more than this . they can not pass a law requiring all police to wear cameras . doing that would be up to state legislators . if you want a federal solution this is the best they can do .
DocQuanta	cj7u4p9	1406325119	. i d just like to point out that this amendment does not end corporate personhood . it merely give congress and the states power to pass laws that discriminate between natural persons and corporations . congress already could do this if they were to redefine person to not include artificial legal entities . corporate personhood is a concept derived from statutory law and not constitutional law so congress is free to change it at any time . what this does is allow congress to make the discrimination without having to redefine person . it simultaneously maintains corporate personhood in general but allow congress to make the distinction between corporate persons and natural persons in specific instances .
DocQuanta	cgu7wll	1397680786	. it is relevant as the same people who propose eliminating the minimum wage also propose ending welfare programs . besides which welfare programs and the minimum wage should serve two different objectives . the minimum wage exists to guarantee people receive fair compensation for their labor . the question is what is fair compensation . i would argue strongly that what is fair is a person working full time at minimum wage being to care for one dependent without being impoverished . welfare programs should exist to support people who can not work full time or who have a large number of dependents . people who work full time and do not have a large number of dependents should n't need government assistance which amounts to a subsidy for their employers .
DocQuanta	ck10zlm	1409072305	. so why then do n't states with high pop density have better internet . the us population is n't uniformly spread . new jersey in particular has a very high population density and has a population larger than quite a few european countries . but new jersey has the same crappy internet as the rest of the us .

DocQuanta	cfv3ytx	1394042448	. it s a good ideal . i agree with it 100 . we should strive to make this true . in the meantime we have to deal with reality instead of whining that the world is imperfect . people who can not afford to have kids do anyway . so unless to plan to advocate for mandatory contraception like in some dystopian scifi novel we have to deal with the problem .

DocQuanta	cm36g35	1416052741	. the question is who is benefiting from this economic growth . wage stagnation the shrinking labor force and increased income inequality suggest that while the benefit to the economy as a whole may be positive free trade detrimental to the vast majority of individuals . it is only a net positive as a whole because the very rich benefit so greatly at the expense of everyone else .
DocQuanta	civyvlr	1405224302	. no sorry . democrats and republicans were able to compromise more or less until the second bush jr term . then the democrats put the breaks on the policies of a very unpopular president . in 2009 when obama took office the gop decided to become completely obstructionist . they have actively tried to derail every initiative obama has proposed regardless of whether they d ordinarily support it . the made a decision to disregard policy to focus only on politics . this is not how things used to work . there is a reason why the senate finally partially curtailed the filibuster because it was being abused as never before . finally you are conflating liberal with democrat . yes liberals will generally oppose most anything conservatives propose . however there are many centrist democrats who will gladly go along with some conservative ideas . there used to also be centrist republicans who be willing to go along with liberal ideas . those do n't exist in congress anymore though .
DocQuanta	ciulcko	1405095703	. that s not entirely the case though . a lot of the newly insured are people who are now on medicaid . also one of the things the aca did is provide loans for the creation of health insurance cooperatives . the one in my state offers plans that beat any of the normal health insurance companies plans on every detail lower price for better coverage with a larger network . creating that sort of competition is not very helpful for the traditional insurace companies .
DocQuanta	civz2bz	1405224799	. except that it is n't a crusade . no democrats have been ranting and raving about the need to replace incandescent light bulbs . it is something democrats support but it is n't something anyone is losing any sleep over . it is just a simple step to reduce electricity consumption with no significant downside .

DocQuanta	cm69w6m	1416342197	. approval voting does n't get rid of strategic voting as ranked voting does . let s say there is a 3 candidate race . a libertarian a republican and a democrat are running and you support the libertarian so you vote for him . you dislike the republican but absolutely hate the democratic candidate . now you have a choice before you . do you vote for the republican or not . if you vote for both the libertarian and the republican you minimize the odds of the democratic candidate winning but you also reduce the odds of your preferred libertarian candidate of winning as well . voting just the libertarian maximizes the chances of him winning but it also increases the chances of the hated democrat winning . with ranked voting no such dilemma exists . you simply pick the libertarian as your first choice and the republican as your second . this simultaneously maximizes the odds of the libertarian winning while minimizing the odds for the democrat .
DocQuanta	ci4m2ea	1402468351	. well at least with amash as speaker we d probably see an anti-nsa bill make it out of the house and that would put a lot of pressure on the senate to do something . that said speaker issa would be a nightmare . the last thing we need is for that blow hard to get a bigger stage .

DocQuanta	cnakv6q	1420055186	. yeah maybe if the tpp was just between the us and japan countries with relatively similar standards of living . the problem is that it includes countries like vietnam and the philippines . instead what we will see is more of our manufacturing moving to these countries and what manufacturing remains will be under pressure to cut wages and costs to stay competitive .
DocQuanta	ci5i6b3	1402555514	. pretty much all of the above posts are actually incorrect . sen cruz did in fact read green eggs and ham on the senate floor in the middle of the night is a pseudo filibuster but that is n't how things actually work . according to the current rules in the us senate there has to be a procedural vote to begin debate on a bill . for this procedural vote to pass it require 60 of 100 votes in favor of proceeding to debate . if this procedural vote fails debate on the bill can not begin and so no vote on the bill can take place . if it passes there is a period of debate on the legislation then a second procedural vote to end debate is taken again requiring 60 votes to agree to end debate . if this fails either debate will continue until there are 60 votes to agree to end debate or the legislation is tabled set aside and the senate moves on to other business and no vote is taken on the legislation . failing either of these two procedural votes either to begin debate or to end debate is called a filibuster . in this particular case sen warren s bill failed the vote to begin debate and so we say it was filibustered . if a bill passes both of these procedures then the actual vote on whether to pass the legislation takes place . a simple majority is all that is required to pass a bill once it is actually up for a vote . historically filibusters were rare . the minority party would only use the tactic to block legislation that they felt very strongly against . senators would routinely vote to begin/end debate on legislation that they did not support . after the 2008 election however the gop began to use the procedural votes to block almost all legislation since the democrats did not have a sufficient majority to begin/end debate without republican s supporting the procedural vote .
DocQuanta	ci9yy8p	1403027208	. honestly the absolute most we should do is provide aerial surveillance for the iraqis . first we really should steer clear of getting into this shi'a sunni sectarian war especially since we d likely end up fighting for/against both bloody sides . second if iraq is ever going to be a functional country they have to be able to deal with this problem themselves . their army folded before isis . if they are n't going to defend their own damn country we can do no long term good . finally if worst comes to worst we can let the iranians deal with the problem . they are already fighting a proxy war in syria against isis . they have more interest in seeing isis destroyed than we do . let them spend their blood and treasure . that said it would be far better if the iraqis kicked out isis themselves as iran saving the day for iraq does no more long term good than the us saving the day .
DocQuanta	cgtnwf5	1397622484	. that is n't really true . the majority of democrats even the majority of elected democrats are not neo-liberals . the progressive caucus in the house for example is a majority of the house democrats . however there is a very sizable neo-liberal minority in the democratic party formerly called the dlc and later the third way . this segment of the democratic party is likely to have a hard time of it soon as populist sentiment in the us is rising .
DocQuanta	cj7ug2s	1406325765	. the issue with corporate personhood is with the 14th amendment . it grants equal protection to all persons . there is a legal argument that this implies corporations may not be treated differently than natural person s under the law . this amendment would counter that position by explicitly allow congress and states to make the distinction between natural persons and corporations .
DocQuanta	ciuo3el	1405100280	. you re making a rather large mistake . profit motives to not lead to increased efficiency if anything they can increase inefficiency . what you re thinking of is competition . markets with lots of competition tend to have more efficient businesses . markets that are monopolies or oligopolies though are a very different matter . if the consumer s choice is a poor product or service or no product or service a company can be very inefficient and still make lots of profit . this is why as a socialist i m very much in favor of socializing natural monopolies or at the very least putting in strict government controls . most utilities already function this way . an alternative method i would also support would be to artificially introduce competition into a naturally monopolistic market . on the other hand i would greatly oppose the socialization of most consumer markets . for example there is more than enough competition in the automotive industry that their is no need or benefit from government takeover .
DocQuanta	cikzwu8	1404151585	. irrelevant . if one company can choose to avoid one type of contraception based on religious objections another company could expand that to avoid all contraception . from there it is possible to expand to other medications or medical procedures that some find objectionable based on religious grounds .
DocQuanta	ci6cxv1	1402637840	. the aca is essentially the heritage foundation s plan and is similar to nixon s plan . the democrats spent about 40 years suggesting single payer . finally the problem got so dire that they capitulated and adopted the gop plan as better than the status quo . yes it is a giveaway to health insurance companies . that s why we opposed it for so long and it is why the gop suggested it in the first place . it has however greatly increased access to health care in this country . it has n't done enough and it does it in an inefficient way but it is the lesser evil .

DocQuanta	cm8e96o	1416523155	. you could say the same thing about gay marriage but there are republicans who would overturn that progress as well if they could and to hell with the consequences . other s are more pragmatic but there are true believers out there and they would crack down on marijuana .

DorkJedi	ckzj5qw	1412358103	. we covered this before . the initial discussion was about public perception vs true volume of occurrence . you tend to slip back in to the per capita lie when the hard numbers do not support your desired outcome . you wanted homicide to be the driving cause police are still 4th on the list . answer the question quit trying to dodge around it why ca n't the professions above that mark carry a gun and preemptively shoot people they feel are a threat to their well being attacked or not armed or not just like cops can . the answer you refuse to provide and the reason you refuse to provide it are both key to this line of discussion .
DorkJedi	ckwovgs	1412099332	. it is you that is ignoring human greed . that is why capitalism unregulated results in concentration of wealth . creating a new capital source merely creates a single new slot in the elite . conversely and for the same reason socialism unregulated allows the same sort of person to live the good life on the backs of others without contributing their share to the load . however the two counter-balance each other very well .
DorkJedi	cet6hte	1390106096	. would you rather work for 3 less but be allowed full time and benefits . or be restricted to 25 hours no benefits and being fired the first time you ca n't take a different shift because you took a second part time job . you ignore the whole picture to focus on one aspect .
DorkJedi	ck55ae6	1409454301	. they are using the money to pay the bonds as they come due . they can bring in the full amount in the case of company failure to pay off outstanding bonds . this is why they are considered a1 no-risk . really do n't try to argue economics when you are so very clueless as to how things work . but i suppose that is why the right wing propaganda machine has you so deeply deluded . total ignorance fed by lies and propaganda makes for a loyal little self-destruction voter .

DorkJedi	ckzl6l9	1412362038	. you ignore the link and the instructions on how to obtain more of police shooting unarmed people and walking away because they felt threatened by the victim . you refuse to address the question . you keep pouring out tons of text unrelated or peripherally related to the question but will not answer the question . you keep trying to claim per capita cops have a more dangerous job in a discussion of total numbers a discussion that has been about total numbers since the initial post . meanwhile ignoring the question asked . just answer cops are allowed to carry a gun and use it on people they feel threatened by whether or not that person is armed or attacks them . why ca n't other professions that have a higher homicide fatality count do the same .
DorkJedi	circsa9	1404796483	. banning is not feasible . but making them pay corporate taxes on every penny earned in the us is . make deductibles hard to prove and harshly judged if needed . money funneled out of the us no matter what the premise is subject to full tax rate funnel out 1 pay 35 on that 1 no deductions . this will stop that hemorrhage of tax money reporting it properly is the only way to get those expenses in creating that dollar deducted .

DorkJedi	ckgt6fb	1410570224	. i do n't see it that way . these people voted in overwhelming numbers for this exact thing . they get what they asked for . demanded even . if we take it away from them they will forever claim it was broken by liberals just when it was about to work . only when it hurts them really and truly hurts them will the voters finally admit they were lied to .

DorkJedi	ckvyuj2	1412029048	. the point you replied to said nothing about per capita . you tried the false equivalency that people are overreacting because cops do n't kill people very often . i pointed out that your position is blatantly false far far far far far more are killed by cops than kill cops . and the plethora of video evidence is telling us it is not a skill mis-match where cops just win the firefights more often . they have a habit of killing the helpless and unarmed at an alarming rate . now lets look at how many have killed a cop and walked away un-prosecuted vs how many cops kill and walk away .
DorkJedi	cf37dmn	1391130818	. look at the numbers . this might be worth looking in to but will have no real impact on the budget . the majority are by far the elderly and disabled . the bulk of the rest are working full time usually at multiple jobs . the real solution is a minimum wage that meets the minimum requirements to live .
DorkJedi	cl31wap	1412708206	. i asked if you would support a satanic bible on a teachers desk . if you support a bible there then the only honest anser is yes . lt please not the period at the end of that . no qualifiers . you either support all possible religions or you keep all of them out of the classroom . you refused to do so and began putting qualifiers and conditions that you did not give the christian . that is why we need separation of church and state . the favoritism inevitably seeps in even from those who think they are being fair .
DorkJedi	ckk37ze	1410892921	. do n't let fear of change be your main limiting factor . gtfo even if you have to walk if your situation is bad . greyhound goes everywhere for 99 and often non-specific destinations i want to go north can be very cheap on standby they will put you in an otherwise empty seat for a little extra profit . go online and look for shelters and assistance groups in your destinations these can provide shelter while you look for work . choose a smaller city rather than a major metropolis as your destination . no not mayberry but cities of the 100k-300k size give you plenty of work options without big city costs . too small a town and you run in to the good-ol-boy network that wo n't hire an outsider . jobs are still worth a try as you pass through a small town talk to loca business owners and be honest . you left your old location because the job market was horrible and you have no support network there . you want to provide for yourself and earn your way in life and getting out of there is the only way to do it . factories oil/gas production and manufacturing are the best bet if you are unskilled labor . most of these will train you and you will start with a livable wage . low but you can survive on it . a union shop is even more likely to have good wages and benefits than a non union place . when you get to the destination you plan to stay in go to a mailboxes etc and get a mailbox . use this as your mailing address use apt 306 instead of box 306 . they allow this and it is less likely to be viewed poorly by an employer . take a pre-paid smartphone but avoid using the data unless it is unlimited . use free wi-fi wherever you can find it . have your resume references etc in there where you can upload them when you apply for jobs .
DorkJedi	cl29bbp	1412632630	. possibly . if the opportunity comes up i will give it a try . but no changing the topic . back to you justifying why cops can shoot people they feel threatened by no matter if they are unarmed or even walking away posing no threat whatsoever . you have to show why cops get this free pass when other homicide riddled jobs do not . you have for more than a week kept trying to change the parameters of the question without actually addressing the question . there it is in it s current form . i look forward to your next evasion and attempt to justify while refusing to address why this right is granted to one dangerous job but not the others .
DorkJedi	ck3wobr	1409333126	. you apparently do not know that bonds are paid back by the issuer . yet you choose to argue economics . how interesting . note they used the proceeds to pay dividends and stock buybacks to head off a lawsuit from stockholders for withholding profits . a loan taken from themselves and paid to themselves . or are you also unaware that stockholders are part of the company .
DorkJedi	ck3zvbf	1409339141	. and your argument relies on lies and falsehoods that have been utterly destroyed . tax evasion and criminal tax evasion are two related but different things . the main difference is the ability to find or pass a loophole that can be exploited to bend without quite breaking the law . it becomes criminal when you bend it too far . either way they are operating outside the intent and letter of the law .

DanGliesack	cknswv1	1411241823	. what s wrong with that . is n't that at least more genuine . as romantic as people would like to be about everyone voting the reality is that if i m telling people to vote i only want the people who are voting like me to listen . why would i want people who are voting against my views to vote .

DanGliesack	cfco6qa	1392139610	. well i think the jobs point is twofold more work actually does mean more jobs these people are paid hourly and there is more work meaning more ages are paid and more people are likely hired . you re right that these are temporary . the other important point is that if a pipeline is built it can lead to industry growth and industry growth will lead to jobs down the line even if those jobs are n't directly working on the pipeline .

DanGliesack	cht5aep	1401289690	. palin was a complete nobody when mccain picked her out . she was governor of alaska and on paper was absolutely perfect . she fit john mccain s maverick brand as she had judged ousted a longtime establishment politician . she had extremely high approval ratings . she had a large family and even a disabled son . this is all on top of the fact that she was a woman and was relatively younger than mccain and so theoretically could have spoken to groups he did n't appeal to . people forget that after he nominated palin they started gaining ground and it was probably the closest the election got at any point . she really added a splash to his campaign which seemed otherwise doa . then obviously she took it back down . it seems like her biggest issue is that she was green . this was a person a few years removed from being governor being on tv and stumping in front of the presidential microscope is extremely scary . and while we think of her as an extreme republican now she was not nearly as out there during the actual campaign . her issue was really just making blunders that made her sound dumb . the newspaper comment for example had she a couple more years in politics and a little more comfort she could have at least made something up . compare her to a guy like biden and i m skeptical biden s any smarter in a general sense . but biden had 35 years of experience and knew how to cultivate an image in a way palin did not . honestly palin was a smart pick . mccain needed to take a risk and she was a good one . she only sunk his campaign as far as she built it up in the first place .
DanGliesack	cgegw7u	1396042795	. it s not as absurd as it s made to sound . the idea is that you re taking a loan you schedule it over a period and the bank is going to charge you a fee based on the size of the loan and the period you choose . all that s happening is that once you agree to those terms you ca n't change the period . if you agree to pay over a 20 year span you have to pay the interest associated with that . just like the bank ca n't say well we changed our mind we want it back in 10 years you ca n't say well i changed my mind i want to pay it back in 10 years for a lower amount of money than i agreed to .
DanGliesack	cjqjfaj	1408060203	. what do you think this article says . it s barely about militarization it s about usage of drones and while drones are used in war zones they are also potentially used in non-war situations like hypothetically burrito delivery in ways that things like mine-resistant tanks and sniper rifles are not . what s more the article is about paul filibustering use of drones in american policing despite previously saying he supported use of drones to catch tsarnev .
DanGliesack	cf8krll	1391702992	. the idea that especially at a high school level sports and music are any different is absolutely preposterous . they re essentially the same thing though in one you need physical ability and the other you need an ear for music . both practice both work in teams both take coaching both need some study beyond simple practice both offer a degree of competition and lessons to learn and both give opportunity for performance . i was a standout in my high school band and an average player on the football team listening to people who only did band shit on sports is unbelievably frustrating and to me always came off as more insecure than anything else . guess what you re probably not going to find playing the saxophone all that useful as anything more than a hobby in adulthood . what you bring from high school music and sports is the lessons you learn and those are pretty similar .
DanGliesack	ciiuwk6	1403906533	. in case anyone needs proof you are talking out of your ass harry reid did not help block student loans . the reason harry reid voted against cloture was because it was clear the bill would fail . in order to take another vote on cloture the new vote needs to be ordered by someone who voted against cloture the first time . the majority leader will almost always vote against cloture if it will fail and there is any chance they will bring it to a vote again . this is a very basic straightforward element of how the senate works . how do you expect credibility when speaking about other more complicated things in the same post .
DanGliesack	ciptan0	1404654175	. that does n't really make sense . costs as a whole are rising so premiums will rise even without adding any coverage . it is a very complicated and controversial question whether birth control is truly free or not . if it is n't free though it s not much .
DanGliesack	cj82332	1406343931	. i think your point is actually fair in that we do n't want to codify the idea of a corporation but it s worth pointing out that the drafters of the bill of rights very clearly imagined they were granting rights to corporation-like entities as well as individuals . freedom of religion was certainly meant to include churches and freedom of the press was certainly meant to include at the very least newspapers . the idea that the constitution is n't meant to cover corporate rights is a total farce it s completely necessary that corporate rights are protected .
DanGliesack	ci5ldh1	1402573535	. there was n't really any refusal to debate reid gets to set the agenda for the chamber and he is free to schedule as much debate as he wants . cloture just was n't evoked which means it will not be voted on . the no debate part of this is misleading .
DanGliesack	cfb20qg	1391972791	. well the actual question is who is the least powerful employee of the executive branch i guess if you consider like a post office intern as responding to the president then that would be less powerful but as far as white house employees go it s tough to imagine anyone less powerful .
DanGliesack	cfc7s98	1392085238	. realistically it s the same as it was with the republicans on women . you do n't ultimately win constituencies by running people who are like them you win constituencies with people who support policies favorable to them . romney won the religious right because his politics aligned with their politics . obama s did not even though he was more christian .
DanGliesack	cig7ge8	1403651258	. eh that is n't really that much of a political concern . people are overwhelmingly in favor of getting softer on soft drug crimes and things like an exploding baby make the defense of position on a no-knock warrant defensible in extremely simple terms . the real issue is that there is very little demand for no-knock warrants to go away . you might say i want them gone and i know a ton of people who do too but that does n't even really mean you supply demand for them being eliminated . do you care about healthcare more . entitlement programs . welfare . the minimum wage . gun control . food policy . tax policy . there s a list of dozens of things that the vast vast majority of people care about more than no-knock warrants and because there is support for the status quo at all the status quo wins by ambivalence .
DanGliesack	cilmsvd	1404214639	. an example of a muslim belief that would be defended by this ruling is this the government decides that all schools must institute a specific dietary standard . it exempts some non-profit muslim schools from buying pork products that it otherwise mandates for other schools . a muslim owner of a for-profit charter school says i also do n't want to buy pork . under this ruling i would suspect he would not have to .
DanGliesack	cn3p6hu	1419376049	. kudos to you because this statement on its own is probably overly simplistic but i think this it gets at a great point . it seems bizarre to blame going to war in iraq on torture intelligence there were a ton of strategic considerations and less genuine considerations as well . but it seems far more likely that after the fact they used torture to get justification for their conclusions not to build bad conclusions in the first place . the people in the cia actually have some incentive to use good intelligence and to make accurate predictions especially in a specific case like this one where their claims will be tested . they ultimately were scapegoated when their claims about wmds were incorrect . so it seems like incentives are far more oriented around water boarding a guy 100 times after they fucked up to justify their error he said they were there you just missed them . than before .
DanGliesack	cfc7s98	1392085238	. realistically it s the same as it was with the republicans on women . you do n't ultimately win constituencies by running people who are like them you win constituencies with people who support policies favorable to them . romney won the religious right because his politics aligned with their politics . obama s did not even though he was more christian .
DanGliesack	cim613i	1404257850	. well now you ve expanded the question . now you re saying some pieces of paper have religions but not others . the question here is not as simple as the idea that an organization can or can not have rights organizations can uncontroversially have rights and can enjoy freedom of speech like a newspaper can and can practice religion like a church can . when someone says an organization can not do these things because it is not a person they are wrong . the question is much more complicated if we all agree some corporations have rights we must decide which do and which do not . your point is not outrageous it is a reasonable legal opinion and there is evidence that supports it . there is also evidence that opposes it . saying an organization can not have rights because it is not an individual is not a reasonable legal opinion . the evidence would overwhelmingly oppose it and i ve yet to hear a nuanced legal argument for why that should be the case . while i find the court s decision reasonable i m not arguing here that hobby lobby should definitely receive rights under the first amendment . rather what i m saying is that those who believe no non-person can have any sort of rights as the poster i initially responded to is suggesting have a ridiculous dangerous argument . even though you and i might disagree on hobby lobby we would almost surely agree that it is reasonable to give churches freedom of religion and newspapers freedom of speech and those things can not exist if a piece of paper as the above poster refers to organizations can not have individual rights of any kind .
DanGliesack	clz0r8e	1415673199	. a lot of this stuff actually does n't play very well with the younger wonky part of the republican base which makes this issue an interesting one for conservative media . often you have people with conflicting values talking past each other in the hyper polarized debates . in this case there s reason to believe that a big part of the republican base will actually support these policies with caveats . and some pushback is actually a good thing here i would like to see internet infrastructure opened to competition much like an oil pipeline but i would hate for the government to take over internet providing or to start regulating it like the fcc regulates network tv .
DanGliesack	cewbax6	1390430191	. i actually do n't think that s true . i have rarely heard advice that a 40,000 a year school is definitely better than an equal 10,000 a year school typically it s quality of student life facilities fit and etc . that i ve seen draw people to more expensive choices .
DanGliesack	ciofoar	1404486682	. it s difficult to find a good source because any search of the necessary terms brings you to hobby lobby discussion but the premise is that as part of the aca the us already exempts thousands of nonprofit groups from the strict requirement of birth control and allows a workaround with the insurers . essentially the court is saying this workaround is allowed by the aca so there is a better non-invasive way to provide birth control . it ca n't force the administration to offer the workaround to private groups but it suggests they do and the existence of the workaround as an option is what wins hobby lobby the case . the supreme court does n't have the power to grant everyone birth control in this case . they are saying your choice of a over b was unconstitutional both provide contraception while one violates religious rights . you ca n't do a . we suggest you do b . and importantly it s not a slippery slope because the court has n't made b up out of thin air . b already exists as an option in the same law that is being questioned .
DanGliesack	ciw8u8r	1405265565	. and importantly it is n't just a happy coincidence that the people will still have birth control the fact that the people will still have birth control is the entire reason for the ruling . the majority did n't just say religious orgs do n't have to offer birth control and then it was really lucky that the government had a backup plan . the majority said look if the government has a backup plan that it s already using in some cases they need to use the backup plan in these cases . the choice for the supreme court was never corporate right to religion vs individual right to healthcare . the choice was corporate right to religion and individual right to healthcare vs no corporate right to religion and individual right to healthcare . the court states that it feels women s rights to birth control will not be reduced and the standard which it sets in striking down the law is that there must be a present alternative which is equally effective in serving the government s interest while encroaching less on freedom of religion .

DanGliesack	ci3iada	1402364853	. i have posted a link in this thread above that puts university of arkansas tuition a little over 6k . fees are a little over 1k and arkansas lists books as 1500 on their site but i certainly never paid that much for books in any of my four recent years in school . i think it s relatively conservative to call that 9k per year though my guess is you could go for about 7-8 if you are creative about books . the meal plan the housing all that is not just paying for your education it is your rent and your food . it does not cost 20k to get your education per year it costs 7-8 or if you want to say 9 k and everything else is what you re paying to live there . these costs do not pay for your education . they may be necessary to get your education but you should separate them from education costs when talking about the cost of school because you would pay them in some form regardless and they give you something that has nothing to do with your education . and if you go to community college for two years and transfer to arkansas and graduate you are not going to be treated any differently regarding your education than if you went to arkansas for four years . the money you save is somewhat on tuition but is mostly that you do n't get those two years living at arkansas and having the college experience that others have . that s an awesome experience for most people and often you hear it referred to as the best time of people s lives but they seem to act like the money they are paying for it is strictly for an education when in reality it is for the education everything else that you did in college . many people talk about college like it is purely an education . it most definitely is not . often the difference in tuition between institutions has nothing to do with the quality of instruction but rather the quality of your life . people say stop glorifying stem majors other majors are important . that s fine . but the big issue is people who are willing to pay 30-40k a year in rent facility access and food besides tuition while getting an education that can not pay back for those things . the tuition itself is certainly rising and that s problematic but it s the rapid growth of the non-tuition expenses and people s willingness to thoughtlessly pay for them that s leading to this colossal debt in the non-grad school cases .
DanGliesack	cf8krll	1391702992	. the idea that especially at a high school level sports and music are any different is absolutely preposterous . they re essentially the same thing though in one you need physical ability and the other you need an ear for music . both practice both work in teams both take coaching both need some study beyond simple practice both offer a degree of competition and lessons to learn and both give opportunity for performance . i was a standout in my high school band and an average player on the football team listening to people who only did band shit on sports is unbelievably frustrating and to me always came off as more insecure than anything else . guess what you re probably not going to find playing the saxophone all that useful as anything more than a hobby in adulthood . what you bring from high school music and sports is the lessons you learn and those are pretty similar .

DanGliesack	clz0kaj	1415672835	. this is actually the above poster s point she like obama is pushing for things . many have grown disheartened with obama because he is willing to compromise to get small victories . they perceive that as spineless while they interpret warren as strong . in reality they both are limited by cooperation of others .
DanGliesack	cixmzaz	1405389709	. the fundamental issue with warren is the same as the fundamental issue with clinton neither has proven to be a particularly adept politician . obama was a really interesting up and comer because he was so clearly charismatic . you watch obama speak and he could absolutely electrify a room while holding the exact same views as his peers did . warren s appeal to liberals is n't her leadership ability or charisma but the fact that her views appeal to liberals . i totally get that you would love to support someone who supports your views but you are far better off with someone who is mostly liberal and has the charisma to win the center than with someone whose views align perfectly to yours but does not have appeal to those with views that do n't align perfectly . warren is a one-term senator who won massachusetts and more importantly she has n't really done much to show anyone that she d appeal to more than her base . i group hillary in that category as well because i do n't think it would be fair to make that criticism of warren and not extend it to hillary as well . hillary is a tremendously non-exciting candidate who has never really had any major political victory . any time she has faced a serious political challenge she has ended up defending her ground poorly . if you re going to nominate a liberal from a blue state it s almost irresponsible to ignore how charismatic and appealing they are . it s not about being a centrist or a moderate because independents do n't necessarily vote for centrists or moderates it s about being able to sell yourself and your platform . warren has never faced a significant challenge . hillary has failed against significant challenges . there is no obama or bill clinton in this race that is there is no candidate who immediately jumps out at you as being outrageously charismatic and likable . for that reason it may be smarter to choose someone who has won tough elections with liberal platforms rather than someone whose platform is just good .

DanGliesack	civgmf8	1405179737	. the basic issue with supporting gay marriage is that it s unclear why you support marriage at all . i actually do support gay marriage but it s not because i think gay people should be able to be married i support it because i think gay people should be equal and the gay marriage debate has sort of become the de facto gay equality debate with sides chosen almost completely based on how you feel about gays rather than how you feel about marriage . what s the point of state-sponsored marriage in the first place . well the first thing is that there are a lot of rights that go along with it . but this is separate from the gay marriage debate because both sides draw distinction between a full-rights civil union and marriage itself . so separate should gay people be allowed to get married from should gay people be allowed to have visitation rights at the hospital because the debate is about the former independent of the latter and this is how both sides define the argument . the primary purpose of state-sponsored marriage has absolutely nothing to do with love between two people and is purely based on childbirth . the state is endorsing a commitment from a man to a woman to take an equal share in childbirth which biologically demands a higher commitment from a woman who must at least carry to term and nurse a child while a man is biologically free to walk away at any point . the state is essentially acknowledging that because a man is biologically free to walk away from the birth there are two vulnerable parties here . one is the pregnant woman who would be forced to make a greater economic investment in the kid in the absence of the father . the other is the child itself who benefits from having both parents around . the state then endorses the idea of a father committing to stay around primarily to benefit the child but also to benefit the mother to some extent . marriage being based on children and not love is still the overwhelmingly dominant view of marriage among many social conservatives . things like if you got her pregnant you marry her stay together for the kids the stigma around divorce and even the idea of not having sex before marriage all come from this child-based marriage . and if marriage is based on love and not on children then what s the point of the state sponsoring it . there are no vulnerable parties that the state could actively try to protect . where gay people enter into this is interesting . if homosexuality was more accepted in socially conservative circles it s possible gay people would n't want to get married . the view of child-based marriage is n't that gay people ca n't be a part of it but rather that it has no use to gay people . if gay people want a kid they must already make a commitment to the state through adoption and there is no unequal biological investment from the partners . for that reason from a purely philosophical perspective neither the state nor gays benefit from being offered marriage rights with an exception made for lesbians who want one parent to be biological though even that will start to bring you down into the rabbit hole of bioethics . ironically the best case for the value of extending marriage to gays is that many people who are homophobes oppose it not for the reasons above but because they are homophobes . if the case against gay marriage was the one above then there is n't a very good argument in support of gay marriage . but because the anti-gay marriage movement has attracted so many people who say things like being gay is n't right and it s not natural it actually does give state-sponsored gay marriage a purpose and that is to make a cultural statement about the equality of gay rights . tl dr if you separate the idea of gay marriage from gay equality it s not clear why the state should marry gays or why gays should want to get married in comparison to straight marriage for which it s clear the state has a reason to endorse marriage . the other side of this then is to say that you should n't separate those things at all because in reality those who oppose equality are opposing marriage for the same reasons they oppose workplace non-discrimination laws and adoption restrictions .
DanGliesack	cmfknk5	1417209657	. right but understand what the complaint is here many people believe a major aspect of this is racial . they believe black people are more likely than white people to get shot by police officers . they think black people are more likely than white people to be held accountable under the law . they think black people are often held to one set of rules while white people typically are held to another . and nowhere is this more salient than when white police officers interact with black non-police as even when race is excluded there is a perception that police are held to a different standard than non-police . you are saying that it is common the da presents something in a different way because he clearly does not believe the person is prosecuted is not guilty . but that s exactly what has people upset they believe there is far more leeway given to a white person and to a police officer than to a black person and non-police officer .
DanGliesack	cjc007a	1406730034	. people do n't really get what inversion means . have you stopped to think why they call it inversion and not outsourcing or some word that more clearly implies a move . the reality is that companies have moved their hqs overseas for years and that does n't recuse them from tax on us profits . what they ve been doing lately is moving all their costs to the us so their sales in say china are pure profit and their sales in the us are losing money . their us profits have been inverted . a way around this might be something like take of revenues from the us apply that to profits to determine taxable profit . but that might be unfair for companies who have been following the rules all along but have a disproportionately smaller margin in the us . the better way around this in my opinion is to just do away with corporate taxes altogether and raise the tax on dividends to the corporate tax rate . this would eliminate a lot of incentives that the government has created for businesses and might technically be a tax cut for dividend recipients but the existence of incentives does n't necessarily justify them as useful and the effective rate for dividend recipients will probably be somewhat consistent . it does n't totally make sense that the government taxes corporations with an income tax that s sort of the issue that s being run into here . it would make more sense to tax the owners of the corporations . then the states and cities can decide how they want to tax corporations to make sure they are paying for their use of local services .
DanGliesack	cik1mac	1404053202	. this is actually a very bad economic argument . first of all there are many fields where there are shortages in labor . engineering computer programming and family practice medicine are all pretty broad fields in which it is relatively easy to find jobs . having some standing unemployment in these fields is necessary and normal to a functioning economy it allows for there to be regular churn in the industries . without going into the complex economic argument it is a good rule of thumb that when everyone gets more knowledgeable more productive and etc everyone benefits at the macro level . if we are to the point where an enormous percentage of doctors and engineers are working mcdonalds drive-throughs that s when we will deal with that issue . but for now the argument that if everyone were skilled nobody would be . does n't really matter if everyone were skilled our economy would be far more powerful our standard of living would be much higher and our purchasing power would be much better . there are unskilled jobs that need to be done and the people doing those jobs need to be able to live on what they re paid . that said at least at the federal level the policy here is reasonable . the poverty line for an individual is lower than a minimum-wage full time job actually with a bit of room to spare . a minimum wage full time job is almost exactly at the poverty line for two people and the expansion of food stamp programs means that if you re close to poverty the federal government is giving you some wiggle room . the question is not whether minimum wage should be a living wage for an individual it seems to be except for in the very most expensive metro areas in the country . the question is whether a single mother should be able to support herself and her two kids on minimum wage or if two parents making minimum wage should be able to support 3 kids . these things are a practical reality but when people are saying all we want is a living wage the honest truth about it is that these people have no clear definition in mind of what a living wage should consist of it s simply more .

DanGliesack	cew8ymu	1390425877	. it s tough to explain without knowing your situation . at public schools usually a tuition increase is from budget cuts . but at private schools interestingly it s just market forces . imagine you re an 18 year-old buying a car . you look at all the cars in the lot and some are more expensive and some are less expensive but you realize that you ca n't afford some so you go with a cheaper one that you re happy with . now imagine your parents whisper in your ear this is the most important decision of your life make sure you choose your favorite . you get a little nervous because the cheap one is n't your favorite and your favorite is pretty expensive but it does n't really matter you wo n't get approved for a loan on your own so it s not an option . but then somebody runs onto the lot and says these cars should be available to everyone and tells you they ll finance you if you want the nice expensive one . there are people who would say no to this but the majority say yes . now imagine you re a car company that builds no-frills affordable cars . your business was doing pretty well but now your customer base is getting stolen away by more expensive alternatives . your big advantage was your price but now that everyone can afford expensive cars they do n't really care so much about price anymore . so you can shrink and struggle to make ends meet as a company or you can adapt and add frills leather seats a/c xm radio nicer dorms more majors specialty programs vegan food in the cafeteria better sports student centers and raise your prices to remain competitive . as long as loans continue to be available to people like they are now it would be extremely difficult to have a successful inexpensive private school .

jaxcs	cjxbeai	1408697441	. gt the other mental stallout i had was that someone seems to think the public streets are the last place to peaceful protest and discuss ideas . just what . it makes more sense if you know a little about mccullen v coakley . scotus in the majority opinion claimed that the streets were historically an area of protest and so could not be restricted . the fact that sometimes pro-life protesters counselors threatened to become violent was not binding since zones around people seeking abortion could be established . a parallel here would be that so long as no one looted the protests counseling should be allowed . just as the people who want to kill abortion doctors and deface clinics have nothing to do with peaceful pro counseling so the peaceful counselors in ferguson have nothing to do store looting . the police are lumping the peaceful counselors and looters together and that is unwarranted . if you loot you should be arrested but not everyone in the crowd is looting .

LitesoBrite	cf305of	1391115984	. as opposed to 40 votes to repeal obamacare and defund it 100 . that s gop idea of being reasonable . shutting down the entire government unless obama agreed to defund or permanently freeze obamacare . that s gop idea of reasonable . i d say i ll cut spending and you agree to raise revenue was n't unreasonable whatsoever .
LitesoBrite	cfgcrym	1392513768	. i appreciate you sticking with the discussion . sorry i came off so glib . if you had n't made it clear what the issue was i could n't have helped out . in ohio they were really messed up one agency sent out letters saying you must apply before dec 12th another stated you can not apply for the program before the 12th . it s like they tried to screw people into thinking they were n't eligible or something . my sister and her <SPECIAL> got their approvals right away and have their coverage . mine got screwed up by the state website claiming i have military income i ve never been in the military . i ended up with five applications in the system trying to fix it lol . finally got them on the phone and they made a note about the military income not being correct . hopefully i hear back this week .

cynoclast	cj1b4wl	1405721884	. specifically because we re allowing 100k people to go without water . generally because we re allowing detroit to die as a city . gt should they provide water for free . because we as a nation can easily afford it . we are an incredibly wealthy nation and we re seriously going to let people go without water . this is n't some rhetoric about people on stamp owning iphones . human beings are 90 water . moreover if they do n't get clean water as it says in the article they re going to steal it or get sick and then cost even more . just as providing free housing to the homeless is the cheapest way to fix their situation and reduce their economic burden the cheapest way to fix this would be to subsidize their water at least temporarily . i mean we can subsidize big oil just fine and we can bail out banks to the tune of 1,000,000,000 but we ca n't get 100k people living next to a freshwater lake water . are you kidding me . gt who will to keep the pumps running . taxes . gt the mandatory government testing . what . gt the salaries of the water workers . who . what .
cynoclast	ceyerqc	1390635123	. it s not an attack on women s rights . the plutocracy does n't want their livestock controlling their own breeding . we are only valuable to them for our economic output and the more of us the better . to them unemployment drives down the cost of labor . underemployment puts the burden of supporting the laborers on other laborers through taxes . it also prevents the need for conscription because many people resort to the military because they ca n't find other work .
cynoclast	cfzx4ew	1394556160	. we also pay alice walton billions for the food of walmart s underpaid workers through the snap program . welfare kings and queens are real but they are the people who pay fox news to convince you that its the poor taking your money it is really the rich .
cynoclast	cl3cu44	1412730038	. gt since when can you not work two full time jobs . or a full time and part time . i suppose that s a fair point but for the sake of not making people work two full time shitty-paying jobs not to be in poverty i personally oppose it as a solution . if society wants someone to perform a service a job society owes them i think if you re going to work a person 40 hours they should be able to provide reasonable living conditions for a whole family . this used to be possible but is not anymore due to inflation outpacing minimum wage and the 0.01 capturing all of the productivity gains of the last few decades and particularly from 2008 onward . the wealth is there and being generated but we ve let the wealthy take it all . the minimum wage is a great way to take it back .

cynoclast	cics9m0	1403296550	. i m not disagreeing with what it causes in the public mind but the root cause is n't that government is bad it s that government corrupted by graft and bribery is bad . and the root cause of that is wealth inequality which is nothing more than a simple power disparity . virtually every grand scale ill in this country and indeed this world can be traced back to wealth inequality . this is not a new or revolutionary idea either gt we must make our choice . we may have democracy or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few but we ca n't have both . <SPECIAL> d brandeis former supreme court justice if we agree that democracy is good then the ultimate conclusion to that is we must have wealth equality . which we very very much do not have . .
reginaldaugustus	cmk81pt	1417638125	. except that the current political parties wo n't care either . the democratic process is not supposed to go vote for me and then i will do what you want . it s supposed to go i m doing what you want right now so vote for me . it s stupid victim-blaming . people do n't give a fuck about political parties because political parties do n't give a fuck about them . if democrats wanted people to come out and vote for them they know how to do it just look at 2008 .
reginaldaugustus	cj9ul25	1406534220	. shooting non-rich people is what i said . the u.s military has a long history of butchering civilians when the rich require it . we re not talking about france or russia we re talking about america . there is nothing an american hates more than another american especially one that happens to be poorer .
reginaldaugustus	cehc1lh	1388867551	. no . the only stem fields that are employable are the computer and oil related ones and only in certain geographic areas . the main problems we face as a society however are n't going to be solved by engineers and programmers . they are inequality racism sexism etc all of which are problems for people with backgrounds in the liberal arts . education is a societal good and should be encouraged no matter what field it is in .
reginaldaugustus	ch1xrcw	1398450995	. gt no one forces someone to work for a certain employer except yeah they do . especially on the lower end of the economic spectrum . gt and you absolutely are allowed to turn down employment if you do n't agree to the terms . sure if you re happy going hungry . it s the same thing as someone putting a gun to your head and saying i ll kill you if you do n't accept these terms . gt if you have a skill set that matches a high demand job you are in a strong negotiating position but the employer still has the advantage . gt but that s life . no it s not . it s just capitalism .
reginaldaugustus	ch2yajk	1398560029	. yes they do . but the ccna voice is an entirely different certification and the ccna is a pre-requisite . i like how you ignored everything i said too . basically you flung out a ton of unsubstantiated bullshit like it was fact . if something works for you does not mean it works for everyone .
reginaldaugustus	cf3n0nu	1391183914	. gt and at least in common use in the us socialism in the u.s is basically a meaningless term alongside things like entitlement . they have actual definitions but in political parlance they are meaningless . gt social ownership of the means of production specifically is not a prerequisite for calling something socialist . yeah it is . that is the basic fundamental idea of socialism . what you are basically doing is looking at an elephant and calling it an ant then saying well there are no definitive definitions of what elephant means . socialism is not a reformist system like social democracy . socialism is a revolutionary system . socialists do not want to compromise with or reform capitalism . we want to destroy it . if socialism does n't require social ownership of the means of production then your definition is completely and utterly meaningless .
reginaldaugustus	cfl1uwm	1392997319	. there was never such a thing as a middle class and convincing people that it existed is the biggest crock of shit in hundreds of years . you are a worker and your interests are the same as every other worker s whether they are mexican black or chinese .
reginaldaugustus	cezaj5c	1390752121	. gt you are correct in saying the supply of most labor far outstrips the demand but this is mostly unskilled labor . yeah those unskilled folks do n't really matter . who cares if they starve or go homeless . gt everyone s getting paid over 100k there no they are n't . there s a great big underclass in silicon valley too . gt this is because they have skills most americans don't nope . it s because they ll work for less . gt so they actually deserve the money . not really . deserves has nothing to do with wages . your wage is always the lowest amount that your employer thinks they can get away with . gt i bet you mcdonals would go out of business haha no . gt i know i sound like an anti-compassionate asshole you certainly do .
reginaldaugustus	cjbfdct	1406671809	. to quote the bls . although workers under age 25 represented only about one-fifth of hourly paid workers they made up about half of those paid the federal minimum wage or less . so you re wrong . gt either way no minimum wage is not intended to to let you comfortably support a family source .
reginaldaugustus	cm0hx90	1415811940	. gt stem circlejerk makes sense on the surface . it can work for anyone individually but not everyone collectively . if everyone got engineering degrees they would be near worthless . that s just not how it works . the stem circlejerk does n't make sense on the surface even . outside of getting a job in the silicon valley bubble stem wages have been just as stagnant as everything else for decades . beyond that stem degrees are n't all that employable either .
reginaldaugustus	cjabca6	1406578089	. who said they are unwilling to contribute to society . maybe if they did n't work a soul-crushing job for pennies they would have a chance to do so . in any case are you just suggesting we let people die . in any case you do n't exactly sound like a contributing member of society .

reginaldaugustus	cfyg3qz	1394399870	. gt service sector jobs can been unionized and they can be good jobs . no they ca n't . because as soon as they pay well they will simply be automated . of course they will be automated one day in the not so distant future no matter what we do . again the problem is capitalism .
reginaldaugustus	ck8ej3z	1409781790	. no sorry some tradesmen make decent money . most do not . there is no lack of tradesmen either . these fields are just as saturated as everything else . the simple fact is that there are not enough jobs for the number of people who need one .
reginaldaugustus	cfvxkkk	1394124523	. it can be a very dangerous job . i ve been threatened and hassled plenty and i am a 6'7 guy who works out regularly and carries a 6 d-cell maglite all the time . i imagine i would have been robbed if i were an easier target . it is a pretty shitty job . dangerous unstable and low pay and you are treated like shit by most people you meet . it was the only thing i could find during my year of unemployment after grad school though .

reginaldaugustus	cezlhcv	1390778753	. gt so why try to raise wages . as i said it s not an ideal . gt small business is good because its individuals working for themselves as opposed to a corporate machine uhh no . a small business exists for the same reason a big one does to generate profit for the owners . gt you would prefer no pay over some pay then . that s a pretty false dichotomy .
reginaldaugustus	ck9h0te	1409878401	. gt money only buys power because people are susceptable to cheap political ads etc if people educated themselves most of the money would be useless nope . money buys votes in congress support from regulatory agencies etc . who gets elected is pretty much irrelevant since the same people who bribe our current officials will bribe anyone who gets elected . the problem is that our society has a few people with most of the economic power .
reginaldaugustus	cj5r5p5	1406144238	. if you own a huge corporation you need to find a way to keep labor costs one of your biggest expenses as low as possible . that means you need a desperate workforce preferably with a huge amount of unemployment . we are not all in it together . the rich benefit from making things harder for the rest of us .
reginaldaugustus	ckv59yr	1411949804	. gt so yeah when you have a system designed to protect your buddies and hold nobody accountable you can call it any way you want it but not capitalism . except that is capitalism . in capitalism a few people control most of the economic power of society . economic power naturally turns into political power and since therefore the capitalist will control both the state and the economy how is capitalism not a system where the rich protect themselves and are not accountable to anyone .
reginaldaugustus	cmr3lhg	1418243344	. gt like i said including all forms of discouraged workers the state rate goes from 6 to 12 . even the tracking of discouraged workers is flawed . we are after all at a thirty year low in the labor participation rate with no signs of it improving . gt we have seen gains across the board construction health care many factoring retail food service . yes and what job gains we ve seen are in low-wage or temporary positions .
reginaldaugustus	cmk7dco	1417637016	. no the democrats would not as the democrats are a pro-business class too . that s why folks do n't care enough to vote for them . if the democratic party wanted to get people enthusiastic they know how progressive ideology seems to work if 2008 is any indication . that they do n't do this leads me to believe they do n't care .
reginaldaugustus	cgu1ik8	1397668487	. except you wo n't . and hell assistant manager and manager jobs do n't pay well especially considering the increased number of duties you have . i work at a pizza place the assistant manages make 10 cents more an hour than i do and i actually make more per hour than our general manager .
reginaldaugustus	ciaiyb1	1403073601	. gt the owners need all the help they can get . no they do n't . workers need all the help they can get . gt . it s not some source of greed where the owners are laughing maniacally . uhh yes it is . it s a way to underpay your employees even more than normally . gt encourage good service . somehow other countries have waiters but still manage to work just fine without the tip system . gt also the waiters work their asses off . so pay them a good wage .
reginaldaugustus	ck78ket	1409679639	. i think you are misunderstanding me . helping people in poverty does not equal ending poverty . minimum wage laws do help fight poverty but they do n't end it . an increased minimum wage should be part of an entire group of policies designed to fight poverty .
reginaldaugustus	ceg84ce	1388745326	. gt if i and another person agree to trade goods/services for a price yes you can have equal negotiations between a very very disposable employee and a large company where one party is threatened with hunger and homelessness . yup . hell even adam smith recognized this sort of thing . . a landlord a farmer a master manufacturer a merchant though they did not employ a single workman could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they have already acquired . many workmen could not subsist a week few could subsist a month and scarce any a year without employment . in the long run the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him but the necessity is not so immediate .
reginaldaugustus	ci9o4fc	1402994257	. gt it probably encourages good service more than places that do not expect tips . no it does n't because most people already know what they are going to tip you before they even see you . what it actually does is gives petty people a huge amount of power over people even lower than them on the social totem pole which is why americans love it . if tipping is supposed to be something extra to reward good service why are people paid less than the minimum wage on the assumption that people will tip . the tip system is bullshit . give service folks a decent wage instead .
reginaldaugustus	cfwdsap	1394159053	. gt but it s a choice for you i know . i mean i totally chose to have this existence . yup . no wait you re an idiot . gt you have determined that you will never have a career with which you can pay for your education . yes that s my fault . i caused the economy to go into the shitter and all of the decent jobs to try up . yup . sorry . gt second you think it is stupid to charge people for education . so do you think that professors should donate their time . publishers should donate books . who pays for the buildings equipment and supplies . yes i am totally thinking all of that . wait are you seriously that stupid . education should be funded by society because society benefits from an educated population . gt you basically spit in their faces by saying that you never intend on paying back into the system why does it matter what i intend . i do n't and never will have the means to so why does it matter . i could have every intention in the world but it d be the same result . gt people just do n't want to work . who the hell actually wants to work . i do n't at least not within the capitalist framework .
reginaldaugustus	cgz3gfw	1398184812	. gt modern profit-motives are almost exclusively concerned with short-term performance you mean capitalist profit-motives . this is not something new . gt want to see a complete reversal of priorities . institute a mandatory holding period for majority investors . how quickly do you suppose they ll start taking turnover into account and looking at ways to address it even when that means immediate profit losses because they re looking at a 10 year time horizon . of course this is n't going to happen . you seem to have a problem with capitalism . i can recommend some alternatives for you to read about . .
reginaldaugustus	cgq61rb	1397256028	. gt you re basing this off of what . history . gt with proper regulation it would n't be concentrated and how do you get such regulation passed when at the current time the wealth is concentrated . there s only one way to do this and i imagine you are n't going to like it .
reginaldaugustus	ceurv4p	1390275062	. gt one of the problems is there are too many college graduates as is . no we are n't . are you seriously stating that society is too educated . gt we need people graduating with medical and engineering degrees . no we do n't . our main problems as a society are n't things that doctors or engineers are equipped to solve .
reginaldaugustus	ceurv4p	1390275062	. gt one of the problems is there are too many college graduates as is . no we are n't . are you seriously stating that society is too educated . gt we need people graduating with medical and engineering degrees . no we do n't . our main problems as a society are n't things that doctors or engineers are equipped to solve .
reginaldaugustus	cgutg4a	1397742612	. no it is a relatively small number of employers and a large number of potential employers . that s why we have a minimum wage to prevent people from underbidding each other to zero dollars an hour . the employer can always afford to wait longer for an employee than an employee can wait for a job . that s pretty simple .
reginaldaugustus	clt8fdc	1415151021	. gt and you can get better pay while you re at it no what they will say is take the original offer or get out because i have 500 applications here on my desk . gt high turnover is one of the biggest costs of doing business no it is n't . if it was then they would change their business model to not rely on high turnover labor .
reginaldaugustus	cercbkr	1389907862	. i really hate hearing this sort of thing . sure poor republicans are voting against their economic self-interest . the problem is not that they do not vote democrat but that there is no major political party in the u.s that represents the economic interests of the poor .
reginaldaugustus	cezar74	1390752816	. gt that make the world awesome due to skilled engineers that studied their ass off . uh huh if you say so . that sort of techno-fetishism is silly though since technological advancement primarily benefits the rich . there s also a ton of poor people in the silicon valley area . gt i d rather pay those guys than fill mcdonalds shareholder s wallets . my only desire is to fill the pockets of the poor . gt the difference is they just educate themselves and become doctors/engineers there is no shortage of engineers in the u.s .
reginaldaugustus	cgjc8sz	1396557387	. so then folks unaffiliated with the campaigns just happen to release semi-political advertisements attacking various candidates . or we just go back to simple bribery . basically you ca n't have democracy in an economic system that concentrates most economic power in the hands of a few people .
reginaldaugustus	cf9jrhr	1391797484	. henry ford did n't care about poor people . he had to pay more because of the threat of unionization and the huge turnover that his factories had . plus a lot of the raises that he gave out came in the form of bonuses and your bonus was lost if his morality police caught you gambling drinking etc . it s strange to see how ford is deified around here sometimes .
reginaldaugustus	ceoaxtj	1389595674	. so forcing you to help feed someone is a greater moral crime than oh i do n't know someone starving to death . got ta say i have no problems forcing a sociopath to do something if it prevents someone from going hungry . lastly you basically want to turn the world into a great big free-for-all .
reginaldaugustus	cewn46l	1390456190	. no not really . i m in income-based repayment and i do n't and likely never will make enough money to qualify for payments . after 25 years the loans are gone . yeah i will have to pay taxes on them but it s not like i ll have any money to pay the irs either . basically it s unlikely i ll ever pay a cent on my loans .
reginaldaugustus	ceithms	1389031619	. if people stopped studying unmarketable subjects then we d just have a lot of unemployed engineers instead . our problem is not with what people are studying . our problem is that we are a society that requires work to survive but does not have enough work especially not enough decent paying work for most people to get . and it s not stem majors . it s cs and engineering majors in certain geographic areas . lastly if the behavior of engineers and programmers on reddit is anything to judge by i d much rather have folks studying the humanities .
reginaldaugustus	ck78ket	1409679639	. i think you are misunderstanding me . helping people in poverty does not equal ending poverty . minimum wage laws do help fight poverty but they do n't end it . an increased minimum wage should be part of an entire group of policies designed to fight poverty .
reginaldaugustus	cfyirnz	1394406144	. you can not mix socialism and capitalism . they are mutually exclusive states . capitalism is private ownership of the means of production . socialism is worker ownership of the means of production . you can not have both at the same time nor can you be partly capitalist or partly socialist . how do you have political democracy with an economic system that concentrates economic power in the hands of a few people . and how do you regulate the people who control most of society s economic power .
reginaldaugustus	cfwdsap	1394159053	. gt but it s a choice for you i know . i mean i totally chose to have this existence . yup . no wait you re an idiot . gt you have determined that you will never have a career with which you can pay for your education . yes that s my fault . i caused the economy to go into the shitter and all of the decent jobs to try up . yup . sorry . gt second you think it is stupid to charge people for education . so do you think that professors should donate their time . publishers should donate books . who pays for the buildings equipment and supplies . yes i am totally thinking all of that . wait are you seriously that stupid . education should be funded by society because society benefits from an educated population . gt you basically spit in their faces by saying that you never intend on paying back into the system why does it matter what i intend . i do n't and never will have the means to so why does it matter . i could have every intention in the world but it d be the same result . gt people just do n't want to work . who the hell actually wants to work . i do n't at least not within the capitalist framework .
reginaldaugustus	cjyvold	1408854005	. gt meaning all jobs are on the table if one has trouble finding a minimum wage job then that s a personal problem . no it s not . there are at minimum two job seekers per open job in the u.s and the competition at the low-end of the socioeconomic ladder is by its very nature going to be much tougher .
reginaldaugustus	cefol4v	1388692478	. gt at a certain point we ca n't continue to prop up those that are failing in life there are many definitions of failure you know . especially when for instance in this game their failures are because of macroeconomic problems . and it s very easy to say that when you are n't one of the people who is being threatened with homelessness and starvation . in any case it s totally good for a society s stability to have millions and millions of armed angry and hungry people with no stake in the game existing at the bottom . yep .
reginaldaugustus	cgq5vye	1397255618	. gt i thought the us was against all this elitism though . why be so against our royalty when you re fine with oligarchs . our oligarchs were a different class of people . they were the new capitalist class which was on the ascendency in the 18th century . they were replacing the old feudal aristocracy . gt i m not fine with them manipulating the government then you are against capitalism since a concentration of economic power in the hands of a few always leads to a concentration of political power in the hands of a few .
reginaldaugustus	ceg84ce	1388745326	. gt if i and another person agree to trade goods/services for a price yes you can have equal negotiations between a very very disposable employee and a large company where one party is threatened with hunger and homelessness . yup . hell even adam smith recognized this sort of thing . . a landlord a farmer a master manufacturer a merchant though they did not employ a single workman could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they have already acquired . many workmen could not subsist a week few could subsist a month and scarce any a year without employment . in the long run the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him but the necessity is not so immediate .
reginaldaugustus	cjaf8bs	1406585226	. the luddites were not anti-technology . they were upset because new technology was being used only for the benefit of the rich and how these conditions turned then from prosperous craftsmen to horribly treated industrial workers . i m not anti-technology either . the use of technology only for the benefit of the rich is only a symptom of the true problem capitalism .

antisyzygy	civs5cm	1405207048	. that seems like a really narrow view of what being in alignment on environmental issues is . there is a lot of misinformation and irrational fear surrounding gmos and nuclear power . it s obvious that climate change is being accelerated by humans . the data is overwhelming . we know how much carbon we take out of the ground and release into the atmosphere and we know how much the earth s oceans are warming . we also have information from rocks and ice cores that give us insight into what has been historic co2 levels among other measurements . there does n't exist much research on the affects of consuming gmos except people just making things up the same way the anti-vaccine folks do i.e . false information or fallacious arguments . gmos might be bad but they might be perfectly safe . we do n't know . though i can certainly see taking some sort of cautious approach why should not knowing mean taking some hardline stance against it . as far as nuclear energy goes solar and wind are simply not going to cut it by themselves . if you pick solar and wind you are also picking fossil fuels . that s a requirement as backup for when these methods are n't generating power and you ca n't store enough of it . if you actually want something that is effectively renewable newer fuel cycles that get invented can use the waste from the previous generations reactors and is actually pretty darn safe then nuclear is what you are after . less people died from nuclear disasters than die from making and installing solar panels . we could have seriously curbed or stopped global warming 30 years ago by relying on nuclear energy .

antisyzygy	chr45e3	1401067908	. gt you are really mistaken on your chronology here . the industrial revolution did n't really kill any jobs it created new ones . lots of them . exactly . i do n't see why this wo n't be the case for the technological revolution . the growth in the tech sector is astronomical . they ca n't find enough software developers . re the industrial revolution perhaps i used a bad example but my point is there has been the same argument over and over . we will lose our jobs if you allow x innovation . however nothing other than short term problems occurred from it . romans replaced laborers with machines . the assembly line replaced individual craftsmen . carriage drivers who were transporting goods were replaced by less than their number in automobile drivers . ad infinitum . gt manufacturing jobs are slipping away even as total production actually increases . robots are simply better at those things than we ever were . robots are also expensive the real reason these jobs are going away is because we have outsourced most of our manufacturing jobs to china . china manages their economy so well some say unfairly and at the expense of people . they essentially baited us into it but it was n't really all that difficult considering our capitalists wanted to exploit free trade anyway to take advantage of cheaper labor pools . robots are really good at doing one thing in repetitive motions but they lack the robustness of a human . a human can make a part visually inspect it for flaws and measure it to see it s within spec then go run a marathon and climb a mountain all for calories essentially . basically you can only replace a human in repetitive tasks that do n't require a robust set of skills . ai is still a really long way off and machine learning is only as good as the human that models the problem you are trying to solve with it . furthermore computers ca n't program themselves in any abstract way there are actually mathematical theorems supporting this . you d need an artificial human or something like it but presumably they d demand rights just like us . gt agriculture once the most labour intensive human activity is so highly mechanized in the developed world that huge tracks of land can now be harvested with a few people those farms that continue to employ large number of workers often do so only because their wages are so ridiculously deflated migrant workers are easy to exploit after all . agreed . but now someone has to design and maintain the machines code the software that manages logistics and manage the business itself . we also can afford more calories than our counterparts since the beginning of time . it used to be that people spent 90 of their resources and time on getting food . now it s a fraction of that . as far as migrant labor is concerned the reason we use them to pick our oranges is because no one can develop a machine that does it as good as a human yet . there are actually a lot of jobs in agriculture like that . the problem is the industry has pushed to open the borders rather than have to pay citizens the wages they d demand for that sort of work . gt and in the service industry we have computers replacing cashiers tellers accountants teachers and even lawyers . some tellers were replaced by atms sure but now someone has to make/manage/code/fill the atms you ca n't replace a cpa yet considering they have a license i do n't think you could replace a teacher this is my opinion but moocs are substandard education it s actually illegal to replace a lawyer with a machine the lowest skilled jobs will be automated and there will be new highly skilled jobs opening up . the lesson here is try hard not to be in that lowest skill bracket . sometimes it s unavoidable but that s why i support a safety net . i just do n't think it will get so bad that 50 of our population needs it . if one want s to work they will be obligated to go to a school for more years of their life . gt where are the new higher paying jobs sir that we can flock to . even if we assumed freeing these people up will create new opportunities where possibly can that opportunity come . technology science and engineering jobs . it software mechanical etc . highly skilled people can make their own jobs and companies which is why i support free education . gt anyone with half a brain knows that the number of good positions here is a stunning reduction compared to the quality and number of jobs a generation ago . our wages fluctuated over the last 50 years . the high point was in the 70 s the low point was in the 90s . we re at 60 s levels now . i am not sure how unemployment compares but last i heard we are not doing bad there anymore either . i do n't believe wages are historically low or decreasing is the point however i do agree they are suppressed . i think the real problem is that wages have diverged strongly from productivity and that the capitalist class has taken all the gains because they own everything and have successfully suppressed wages at home . they ve essentially stolen the wealth we ve all created together . that s why we see wealth inequality right there . i support doing something about it . we should force them to reinvest it back in the system that enabled them to succeed or at least encourage reinvestment in the capital classes businesses in a way that benefits everyone . for example if you get taxed on profits you lose it for good but if you are allowed to spend it on a employee instead maybe you can grow your business and have sustainable profits . i.e . force a strategic shift from short term gains to long term ones . gt the standard reply i hear to this is that well it s more efficient . but if all the wealth goes to those that own the machines that is pretty inefficient for a stable and fair society . i actually have serious problems with the way we allow a handful of people to own such huge volumes of property as well as how we let groups extract natural resources almost for free . i think we should nationalize a lot more things than we already do .

antisyzygy	cfjc65m	1392830716	. gt right . the problem is that an optimum wage is completely dependent on the value of the wage earner s labor . so how can an optimum wage be universal if that value is different for every industry business and employee how pray tell do you value someone s labor . is it in what they produce . it it in what they will accept . the optimal wage may be different for each industry but the point of setting a universal one is to find the bare minimum that accomplishes a reduction in poverty while not seriously affecting the other variables i mentioned . it s easy to coerce someone in poverty to accept an even lower wage than their labor is actually worth they get to choose between no wage and a pittance . the value of their labor is deflated on purpose by unethical employers because they have someone they can exploit . setting the wage floor is also to prevent this abuse and coercion . gt setting a wage floor only prohibits employers from utilizing labor that is valued less then cost set by the floor . they pay some people 3 dollars a month to make rugs while the sweatshop owner is pulling in thousands . the value of their labor i.e . making rugs is in what they produce . if they are getting a pittance from what they produce they are being taken advantage of . many people can not avoid being taken advantage of because they have no other options . human behavior breaks this efficient idea you have . if 10.10 was the optimal wage for a business and this business was n't forced to pay it many of these businesses still wo n't pay it even if it s financially and economically justified . they have a poor labor pool they can exploit essentially coerce into taking less than they are worth . minimum wage is meant to combat that by finding and setting the optimal wage i speak of .

antisyzygy	cjk6x2l	1407468255	. that s what you get with a first past the post presidential system . bear with me a republican cares about a subset of their party s platform . they do n't believe necessarily in all of it . a republican can simultaneously think that businesses are overtaxed but that weed and gay marriage should be legal . however they care more about businesses being overtaxed so they identify as republican . the same goes for democrats . you can simultaneously think that businesses need to be taxed less but support a social safety net and nationalized healthcare perhaps because you think capital gains and income should be taxed instead to pay for it . you just care more about socialized healthcare than businesses getting taxed too high so you identify as democrat . in reality most people identify with republicans on some things and democrats on another but since they have to choose one or the other when they vote in order for it to make a difference they have to accept one subset of shitty deals or another . you can try to vote for another candidate but you get washed out by the fact you need majority vote to get a seat . even if 33 of the people voted for a libertarian or green party etc . a 34 of the vote to party x beats them . party x get s the seat regardless if it it was a close call . the system currently encourages us to fight over our 0.1 majority and the best way to play the game is to only have two parties . it s not that the parties are the same it s that they do n't represent all people . you end up with some complicated equation to determine votes based on 50 different sub-issues . the more people that agree with your stance on those 50 different sub-issues the more votes your party gets . however most people do n't give a shit about 25 of them and care little about another 15 . we are left with democrat candidates that ca n't do everything right because they represent a diverse set of interests and republican candidates that ca n't do anything right because they are in the same boat . there just is n't any way for us to be happy with our candidates in this system . it s by necessity two-dimensional when your political stance has at least more than four or more dimensions . we really need some sort of parliamentary system where the seats go proportionally to the party we as the people voted for . that s why canada the uk etc . have more than 2 parties in their government legistlature and also why they can get at least a few things done rather than squabble about the one insignificant issue that just so happens to divide the voters 50-50 .

antisyzygy	clyssnq	1415657644	. gt counter to what you might think the law s job is not to make people treat each other well . first off i ll note you are being condescending here and completely misrepresenting my argument at the same time . it s not about treating others well . gt it is to promote that which is good to society and stop that which it is not . agreed . at the moment there is no law protecting people from having their freedoms coerced away and this is bad for society . gt there is a whole toolbox full of tools you can use to stop companies from doing things you do n't like . for me . maybe . for others that need a paycheck to survive or avoid homelessness not so much . it s a one-way exploitive relationship . it s effectively economic coercion . gt trying to crush their freedom to choose by using the law is pretty hypocritical when your intent is to stop them from oppressing someone else . a company would be less free if we prevent them from taking freedom away from other people . well i guess you re technically correct . they would no longer have the freedom to economically coerce freedoms away from other people . however i d say the people being coerced deserve to have their freedom protected as much as the business does if not more . freedom is for all people not just a handful of business owners .
antisyzygy	ck3sz4e	1409326014	. gt the tired ass bicyclists break laws dialogue in every thread when drivers usually break the exact same laws is really not helping . brushing the problems under the rug or deflecting the blame does n't do cyclists any good . just because some automobile drivers break rules does n't excuse cyclists doing it . you might be the most considerate law-abiding cyclists on the planet but there are plenty of cyclists that are total dicks to pedestrians and do n't obey traffic rules so they end up being dicks to drivers as well . i ve seen them run red lights run stop signs use crosswalks as their own personal traffic light literally cut people off by swerving through multiple lanes use sidewalks as their roads and smash into people in the park on walking paths . at both universities i went to a cyclist ended up injuring a pedestrian by crashing into them . it was common for cyclists to speed around on campus sidewalks and the mall between classes before they were banned completely . i also ca n't count the number of times i ve been on the sidewalk and told not asked politely to move out of the way . keep in mind it s illegal for them to even be there in the first place . notice i am not saying people who drive cars are not to blame sometimes and i do n't think every cyclist is a bad apple but enough of them are to non-drivers that drivers do it too is n't an excuse .
antisyzygy	ckfgl9y	1410454619	. yeah it s shit . unprincipled congresspeople that are too weak to do what is necessary to actually do it the right way . it really should take a new amendment to do anything like that imo . gt if they really wanted to get rid of those amendments they should have to pass another one .
antisyzygy	ciqydau	1404765293	. there are n't any ifrs because a lot of voters are firmly against nuclear power . it s mostly a democrat issue that s what their voters want i am a moderate fyi . frankly they are against it for no good reason other than irrational fear . it s already proven to be safe and cost effective vs things like coal and even solar . i d suggest watching pandora s promise on netflix . they take a geiger counter all around the world to chernobyl to nuclear waste sites and natural places . you d actually be surprised that natural radiation is far stronger in many places around the world than you d get by strolling through the cask storage areas at nuclear plants or even chernobyl . there are people living in cities who regularly get more radiation from purely natural sources than you d get by living in parts of the exclusion zone . as far as we can tell the cancer rates are n't that much worse . waste containment is an issue for sure but not as big as you d think . you can thank irrational fear mongers for blocking it . yucca mountain was supposed to be active in 1998 and it would have held all the nuclear waste produced in the usa up until this year . scientists and engineers designed it to be safe . however disposing of nuclear waste is actually easier than needing to put it all in yucca mountain you leave it in the storage pool at the power plant until you ve built a nuclear plant with a modern fuel cycle to use the fuel in just like we did with the ifr . keep in mind we also do n't have a national fuel reprocessing plant to recycle anything and we are n't building ifrs that can actually use most of the nuclear waste out there as fuel . so it s likely that any waster storage facility would have lasted longer if those were n't being opposed too . the ifr can use as much as 99 of it s fuel s energy content . traditional reactors use 1 . you do the math on how much less waste we d have . by blocking these waste repositories newer plants from being built and technology like the ifr we ve made the nuclear waste storage problem a reality . we worried about it and our worry caused a self-fulfilling prophecy . meanwhile as of right now being anti-nuclear is essentially being pro-fossil fuel since that s the only realistic alternative we have . wind and solar still need fossil fuels as backup . nuclear does n't and we could have had most of our power coming from that 20 years ago rather than sitting her still waiting for viable renewable energy .
antisyzygy	cfjjsbx	1392845474	. gt you are . you re saying we need to raise the minimum wage because you can not support a family on it yes . i am not which would be evident to anyone capable of reading something that has context . i am saying that low wages actually affect people like families which you free market sycophants completely ignore or justify with illogical nonsense . gt not according to economic theory . so not according to your arm chair economic theory based on a fantasy you have about the way the world works . gt um no its not . employers hire based on price and cost/benefit analysis so changing the price will affect the labor pool . the cbo just released a report confirming this . it will affect the labor pool . however there are numerous variables that affect unemployment . that cbo report showed a very minor loss of jobs for a very big benefit namely reduction of poverty . like i said unemployment can be tackled separately considering more variables affect unemployment than minimum wage laws . you seem to think it s the only variable . i hate to blow your mind here but it s not . gt has no one noticed how one government policy is never enough . government regulation leads to government regulation leads to government regulation . it s like fucking whack-a-mole . you ca n't control one part of the economy and expect there to be no effects . this has been proven in virtually every economy in every society . price controls just do not work . the 1970s oil crisis rent control minimum wage they all have negative adverse effects proven throughout time . now you are just spouting off nonsense . regulations are necessary for fair competition . otherwise you get monopolies like standard oil or oligopolies like internet service providers and cell phone companies . there was a time with limited economic regulations it corresponded quite naturally with something called serfdom . who will stop the comcast merger . the free market wont . our wallets wo n't . regulations do n't cause this sort of crap companies do through their natural evolution . larger companies have more resources to use to grow larger and more property to exploit for profits . gt no sir that s incorrect . the employer/employee relationship is not the only relationship that exists in an economy . that absolutely wreaks of false dichotomy . it s the only relationship that exists between the workforce and the employer . poor people can either a not work or b work . often the choice to work is heavily correlated with minimum wage jobs . so though it s a simplification to say a minimum wage job is the result of them working i made no false dichotomy . it s the same thing as simplifying 90 of the time something happens and most of the time something happens . gt hahaha no they are very much the same thing . if you re the poster boy for the party that wants to pay everyone a living wage then you d better be damn sure you re paying everyone who works for you a living wage . if you drive a tank around while chastising me about the environment for driving a prius well that s completely irrational right . your standards are unrealistic and frankly idiotic . you are reaching extremely hard here . i maintain there is literally no comparison . you are basically saying that democrats are hypocrites for not paying people whom volunteer their time . great point . let s make the salvation army pay their volunteers too . this is completely different than employment . gt yes we do . anyone can join a union . just because people choose not to does not mean we do n't have them . gt again yes we do . we have unions in the us and anyone can join them . just because people ultimately decide it s not worth giving up a significant portion of their paycheck for very little return does n't mean we do n't have them . you can join a union and promptly lose your job because the corporation you work for has the right to terminate you for pretty much any minor reason they see fit . otherwise they have an army of hr folks and lawyers ready to pound you into the dirt exhausting your resources with their superior resources . employers do n't want unions . even if you are free to join one you are n't free to keep your job afterwards . the lack of any protection for this is exactly why there are no unions in the us . people are poor so they can not afford to lose their job . the company has them by the balls . many corporations have a branch of their corporate office specifically intended to bust up any union activity on their properties . there wont be any unions not because people do n't want them but because the way the legal system is the way it works and how much resources these corporation have . there is literally not a single protection for people who want to join one . there are these legal protections in germany austria sweden etc . which is why they do n't need minimum wage laws .
antisyzygy	cjp8uh5	1407952935	. people that have a dui needed intervention far before they got their 4th . people who get to their 2nd or 3rd are usually addicts who are n't thinking straight . they should be mandatorily locked up in a mental health treatment center for awhile . the fines and costs from prosecution should already be paid for . they are paid for by the tax payer which is everyone including most people who are being tried for something . that s my point . there should simply not be any costs for prosecution beyond what we already paid for and even if there are it certainly should not be the responsibility of the accused . this is a conflict of interest . in encourages prosecutors to railroad people courts to levy the highest fees possible and courts to try to seize property willy-nilly just so they can fund their collective departments . it encourages the justice system to streamline the asset seizure process as a means to get more funding . they do n't have to ask the voters for more funding anymore they can take it .
antisyzygy	cemh0wv	1389391764	. gt did the worker invent develop their produce . seriously . you do n't think workers develop products or invent new ones . shit i invent stuff all the time that we use at work and i even develop products too . i happen to work for a good company that actually gives us a share of what we make . most people do not i got lucky . gt did they risk their capital to secure the means of production . no because they will never have enough money to do that with a plutocratic class of people hoarding all their ill-gotten resources bending the laws so that they can accumulate more and more at the expense of everyone else . gt are they accountable if they do not produce profit . yes they are . ever hear of being fired or laid off . gt no they sell their labor on contract . they risk little and they are rewarded for the risk that they take . they are the only reason companies even can make products in the first place so they deserve a little bit more appreciation . if your labor nets me 500k a year then i am basically stealing from you if i only give you 30k of it . it should be a more equitable arrangement . i do n't deserve 90 of the wealth you produce just because i own the desk you sit at and rent the building you work in . i do n't have a problem with the existence of rich people but calling them producers and saying all of them deserve it is ridiculous . you are making excuses for people that can just as easily be users and takers and many of them are . there are producers but there are far more owners collecting rent . companies are composed of people not one rich guy s money . the investors deserve a cut for getting a company started but the employees do too far too many companies do n't give their employees shit for how much profit they actually generate e.g . walmart .
antisyzygy	chr7ekz	1401076527	. gt we are n't talking about armageddon here we are using our logical brains to be able to predict the end-point of these changes this is n't logic it s speculation . it seems to me that you are assuming an extremely pessimistic view of how humans react to change a static view on economics and an extremely optimistic view on the progress of technology . i did n't say stuff is n't changing i was telling you that you need to check your assumptions . it may affect your sense of urgency here . gt which is that many many many human hours of work are going to be replaced both physical and mental labour and we have absolutely nothing to replace them . all we ever have done as human beings is lose human hours of work . there is still work to be done . we have 40 hour work weeks because lots of man hours were lost . we have a better standard of living as well because man hours were lost . people used to spend 90 of their time and resources on just obtaining food and shelter now we can devote time to leisure and resources to luxuries . gt this is again why the comparison to the industrial revolution and its aftermath is a false equivalency from which to draw some sort of comfort . it s not a false equivalency it s an extrapolation based on how humans react to challenges like this in the past namely socioeconomic changes . it s also paired with my understanding as a former grad student in ml research of the current state of the art in ai and ml as well as current experience in the software industry . i maintain we will be fine . there will be jobs and i say that mostly because i understand that ml/ai is n't capable of replacing a human yet except in very specialized circumstances that require lots of research . gt the people losing jobs could simply side-step into equivalent or better positions . today we do n't have that . we do have jobs to step into i outlined this already . it s not going to be a side step but it s a step up in skill for a lot of people . that s actually the major problem . we wo n't have a job a cashier can side step into they will need to go back to school . gt those jobs already exist and are occupied . do you not understand that . it does n't take a million more designers to create robots . i do n't think you understand . machines can not do what you think they can do yet and they will not be able to for longer than you think . humans are very far from being replaced in the numbers you are assuming . jobs in many sectors including using/designing/fixing robots/automated-processes are growing . we do n't need 1 million designers for 1 million robots i never said anything like that . this is a straw man . what we need are people to design the robot design the manufacturing process diagnose/maintain the manufacturing facilities diagnose/maintain the robots write software for the robots manage the robots network everything together discover new algorithms improve existing algorithms discover new materials find better ways to extract resources etc . this list is absolutely massive and all of those sectors are growing . it would be necessary for robots to replace people in the first place no . the kind of infrastructure you are imagining to support mass automation of everyone will not exist for a very long time so humans have plenty of time to adapt . one job will be automated more will open up supporting that effort . people will have enough time to move around . politics will slow it down further . i still maintain even 100 years from now there will be plenty of jobs assuming no market collapses from other issues like the housing bubble they are just jobs you and i ca n't imagine right now because again we are shit at predicting the future . industries grow and contract . software engineering and ai/ml/robotics research is growing at a very fast pace because people need things automated . they need it maintained after those systems are built . one automation project comes and the next one comes up before the other is even finished . these projects can always be improved and frequently are . they need constant monitoring and maintenance . they need people managing technology infrastructure . they need people marketing the product . they need people running the business . there will be work here until we create artificial life and then i d be more worried about something else . gt where is the money going to come from . this is a fantasy . you are talking about shifting huge amounts of money into creative and research endeavors and by proxy expecting both private and public entities to increase research budgets by thousands of percent . i d argue that we d need to throw lots more money at research just to get automation to the level you are thinking of . i do n't think it will be as drastic as you think . baby steps . it s already happening with big data start ups and more traditional ml research companies like companies that build computer vision products for manufacturing facilities . companies are realizing the potential and throwing money at it creating lots of jobs for data scientists software engineers database architects etc . gt listen we can either face reality that the developed world is facing a huge economic change or we can stick our head in the sand . a huge economic change on what time frame exactly . i say it s not huge because i think it will be far more gradual than you think . at this point i d say agree to disagree .

antisyzygy	cfhzq81	1392691499	. saying if the states were blue they d still be on the list is my way of telling you as simple as possible that whether these states vote republican or not is n't important . it is an almost completely unrelated variable in determining what their federal spending per dollar of federal taxes is . think about it . what variables affect federal spending per dollar of federal taxes . this is a ratio . it gets larger when federal spending is larger or when federal taxes are lower . however we all pay the same federal taxes no matter what state we live in . so tell me why do you think this ratio is larger in red states . i think it s because they have low population density which i ve shown you . you think it s because republicans . my hypothesis is following occam s razor . your hypothesis requires some sort of massive republican conspiracy across many states .

EchoRadius	cfq6yf0	1393522788	. on reddit yes . but the government or any other large over seeing body needs to step in and arbitrarily take the data to analyze it to effectively determine exactly where all the money is going and then to take necessary steps to move the issue in a forward direction . i know i know socialisms and all that . at this point in the game i just do n't care . right now the insurance industry and healthcare industry are holding all the cards working with each other to determine how much is going to be charged and reimbursed for procedures . both companies have all the incentive to make as much as humanly possible yet no where in the equation is the person that actually pays the bills or receives the procedures . it s 100 backwards .
EchoRadius	cihwikx	1403815078	. that s a really hard question and you make a really good point . yes you re right to a degree but on the other hand you ca n't ignore the fact that a company is making money from someone else s content . if that content is not available then they do n't have a business . in a hosting situation i d refer to netflix s model where they pay a price for the content which is then distributed on demand to the user . in this court case though the provider is not paying for the content . now if a person uses their dvr to record their show it s fair because they re paying for the original content anyways . but if we kick it back a notch and say a person has an antenna and records the show do we refer back to the old vcr ruling .

EchoRadius	cf72ino	1391548722	. breaking the cameras was bullshit and i certainly do n't condone that by our police force . i m just saying we re missing a lot of information . maybe the police were acting like bullies . maybe that whole department is full of raging assholes i do n't know . i m just pointing out some gaping holes and items that need further explanation . if you disregard the poor me part of the story this is what we have security cameras all in and outside the property which is perfectly fine except they say it was for hobby . come on that s bullshit . any other explanation would ve been fine . one person was arrested with intent to distribute . though that was not the original intent of the warrant and we do n't know exactly how much product was involved . we just know the amount was supposedly high enough to breach possession and went directly to intent to distribute . the one guy was honorably discharged and according to the wiki for instance service members rendered physically or psychologically incapable of performing assigned duties normally have their service characterized as honorable for all we know the guy was going nuts and it was noted in his file . so here s how i see it the police for whatever reason wrong or not have some sort of information regarding criminal activity that leads them to this house . further research shows it s occupied by someone that s been honorably discharged psychological problems . we really need to know the answer to this . and the property is surrounded by security . all together this might raise a red flag with someone they might decide it s better safe than sorry and send in a swat team . now after everything went down it s all omg what a bunch of assholes . hind sight is 20/20 just sayin .

armauld	cmnoked	1417943778	. gt the victim was presumed to be telling the truth my point is the alleged victim should be presumed to be telling the truth . so should the alleged criminal . let s assume they are both telling the truth until the evidence tells a different story . if the evidence is inconclusive the charges must be dropped but unless there is conclusive proof showing that the victim is a liar we should continue to assume that both parties are innocent and treat them accordingly . it s a bit silly to suggest that it s okay to treat a crime victim like they are guilty of filing false charges simply because the police have n't charged them with the crime .
armauld	cm6etfz	1416350668	. okay you may well be right in this case i m from the pacific northwest so my knowledge of mississippi politics is limited . that said this is n't the first time a group has tried this garbage though . so there may be some cause for concern .
armauld	ckvt0sq	1412018312	. she and/or obama are too right-wing for my tastes but they are n't republican right-wing . i d love to see either sanders or warren win the dem nomination but i wo n't split the vote by voting 3rd party and hand the election to republicans if hills wins .
armauld	cmbe27z	1416810368	. no . we do n't get to ignore the u.n and invade sovereign countries to show our daddies how big our balls are and enrich halliburton . we have had enough human rights violations here at home that another nation could decide they are exceptional and invade us or send u.n . inspectors to ensure our elections are fair . i guarantee you would n't think that was okay . we ve messed with central and south america southeast asia africa and the middle east . you need to shake off the u.s.a . u.s.a . propaganda and take a fresh look at our behavior .
armauld	cm8jy60	1416534545	. gt it does n't break the first amendment . otherwise the majority of top judges would n't have ruled the way they did ahahaha good one . gt you continue to ignore the foundation of this no i do n't . i do n't think the taxpayers should have to pay religion s bills . that s also a breach of the first amendment .
armauld	ckw0vdo	1412033258	. ummm no . republicans have no ideas or direction . all they ve thought about for the last 6 years is how to make america worse by making obama look bad . if it means no initiative on jobs the economy or even shutting the federal govt down to extort their way out of a legal bill they ll do it .
armauld	clky88w	1414392950	. gt otherwise it means some guy was clever enough with words to get out of paying taxes and some other guy wrote it down well no it means the exact opposite of this . jesus was n't getting out of paying taxes . he was telling people to pay their taxes and give the money back to the guy with his picture on the coin . plus jesus says to pay your taxes again in matthew 17:27 and paul says to pay them in romans 13:6-7 .
armauld	clji5el	1414259207	. see it s people like you who are the problem . read what i wrote . i m saying two groups of people have been victimized by institutions . the accused and the sexually assaulted . that is n't anti-men in the slightest but you ve got to turn it into the whole tired women are lying harpies and men are the only true victims bullshit . i m saying that colleges for decades have suppressed sexual assault claims because they do n't want bad reputations for being unsafe . this pattern of behavior has caused an over-reaction and caused the pendulum to swing too far the other way . what we need to do is bring that pendulum back to the center and recognize that there are falsely accused and there are actual assault victims . both deserve fair treatment .
armauld	ckqv41e	1411524014	. gt you still have n't said when i insulted you . yes i have you are just being pedantic . gt well put . why it s the very question i ve been trying to bang into your head all day . it s too bad you do n't seem interested in answering that question . it s hard to answer any point when you re being sucked into a word swamp . you get stuck in the mud of pedantry and the murky nitpickery swallows you up . but i will answer the question does it help with right-wingers . of course not . but then nothing will . they will not see me or your daughter as humans no matter how many niceties i use . however it does get the attention of the fence-sitters . they want to know why i say such things . then i calmly and without insult or exaggeration i explain what republicans have tried to do . by the end they almost invariably agree that what i said was n't an insult but reality . gt you re really hung up on that one word musing . not sure why since it s not the thing saves my rhetoric from being an insult you said it was . you said i was finally getting the point when i put musing in front of hateful . gt i see . well when are you going to get around to doing that . done and done but you have too much rhetoric gumming up your eyes to be able to take it in . gt fight for the cause in some way shape or form yes i do n't consider voting alone to be fighting . it s showing up once every four years and pulling a lever . but maybe you do fine . allow me to clarify where the bar should be it s when you can look your wife or daughter in the eye as they are dying from a complicated miscarriage and say i tried to stop this . if pulling a lever every four years or even two years if you vote in midterms is enough for you to conscientiously say this to one of your loved ones that s good enough . gt mmm maybe but i do n't think so . go look up the definition of character and let us know what you find . . gt 1.the aggregate of features and traits that form the individual nature of some person or thing . hmm i wonder if rationality is a trait that forms an individual gt maybe people who think carefully do n't have the frustrating encounters that you have . i m sure that if they end up dealing with pompous quibbler like you they face similar frustrations . gt well lately we ve been dwelling on the boring topic of whether me questioning your ability to reason carefully constitutes an insult because that seemed important to you it s not important to me and it is an insult . gt the excellent question you posed above about whether hurling insults is effective in let s say grass roots politics . that would not be boring i ve been trying to get back there but i m neck deep in a sludge mire .
armauld	cm85wh6	1416508364	. the problem is you ca n't use rfra to overrule the constitution or to allow gender-based discrimination . employers do n't actually pay for those pharmaceutical plans . taxpayers do through employer tax breaks and employees cover the rest as part of their salaries . employers simply facilitate the plans to save employees money through collective bargaining . i do n't think this is an ideal situation but it is what it is . to allow employers to refuse to cover women s pharmaceuticals like they cover men s is religious-based discrimination and theft against women and taxpayers . if rfra allows for this to happen then rfra should be overturned as unconstitutional . it certainly should n't just allow more unconstitutional rulings .
armauld	clmnba5	1414538427	. you were n't watching last election huh . do n't you think it s odd that repubs care soooo deeply about the possibility of voter fraud but do n't care at all about a system that does n't show anyone where the votes come from . why do you o brilliant republican think that is .
armauld	ckxjprq	1412180009	. both really . i strongly dislike rfra but i also think it s a huge stretch to limit pharmaceutical plans when there is clearly no more complicity in handing an employee a comprehensive plan or giving them their pay check . both may or may not be used to acquire birth control and it he only conscience that should be affected is the employee s .
armauld	cki2pei	1410713844	. it s so much more complex than that . i find it odd how little of the bible that christians understand . the majority of people are n't going to heaven according to the bible . heaven is like management . the majority of people will be resurrected on paradise earth . the wage of sin is death sounds scary but what it means is that by dying our sins are wiped clean and we get a clean start .
armauld	ckyhe72	1412265677	. i m getting annoyed with this . to sum it up your argument is that america is just unlucky and all the other nations doing better with more social programs are just super lucky and we ca n't prove that all the stuff they are doing has anything to do with their miraculous success amirite . so your answer is to invest even more heavily in the system that by all appearances is dragging america into the gutter and plugging your ears and singing when the other countries economies continue to improve while ours tanks . sound about right .
armauld	ckiufmr	1410787414	. ahahahah any libertarian associated with the republican party is not a libertarian at all so unless you are talking about a handful of gary johnson supporters you are sadly mistaken . for example ron papa doc paul supports texas s right to invade gay men s homes and arrest them for adult consensual sex because you know liberty .
armauld	ckyp32i	1412279979	. does your business use the roads and other infrastructure that gay people pay taxes to build . do you think you get to use what all members of society provide then discriminate against them . go start your business out in the woods without roads or utilities . then you can serve whomever your blackened shrivelled heart desires .
armauld	ckcheo9	1410188066	. okay but back that up . if bush had n't lied about nuclear capability/harboring he would n't have been forced . it s like if i were to falsely accuse you of several crimes then say it s not my fault that i m forced to testify against you . dick cheney engineered iraq . it s his/dubya's/blair s fault it happened .
armauld	ckxlwvt	1412184130	. all things in moderation . we need trace amounts of selenium to live . too much is deadly . we have a choice to keep society from crumbling and the current generations from suffering in old age . we can reproduce or we can allow immigration but we need new taxpayers to keep society going to pay into social security to do jobs to keeps infrastructure from crumbling . so absolutely there is both a cost and a benefit with kids . however parental leave pays for itself because early childhood/parental bonding is vital to lower violence in children and eventually adults higher school scores less cost to the health system social services jail etc . we need to start thinking a little more proactively and long term here it s like having a car and giggling to ourselves because we are saving so much money not bothering with oil changes . it ll come back to kick us in the ass if we do n't start taking better care of our society .
armauld	cktpe1u	1411791073	. they grow up hearing stories of the good ol days when women and coloreds knew their place . gt i repeat my earlier response and then you ignore it again . it s like the movie groundhog s day . except i just provided yet another source backing up my claims that you conveniently ignore . gt but i ve rebutted the things you re repeating and you have n't responded to my rebuttals . you just ignore them . no all you do is announce how carefully you reason so you must be right . i provide citations you ignore them then you declare yourself more logical so that means you re the judge of who s right and wrong . that s not a rebuttal . that s just dumb .
armauld	cm8gyqp	1416528487	. entirely different situation since no one is forcing bc on the premises or forcing anyone to handle it or have anything to do with bc if they choose not to . it be more like telling jewish employers that they ca n't stop employees from using salaries or bonuses to buy pork and use it at home . compensation is salary btw . you are compensated for your work with your salary and in this case a health plan in lieu of part of your salary .
armauld	ck1050j	1409070683	. gt but you will not focus on the bigger picture i love how the bigger picture never includes institutionalized racism homophobia and sexism . the bigger picture is always only how straight white fake christian men are affected . gt which side of the ideological divide is it that put the laws into place that allowed homeland security swat teams to invade the private properties of innocent citizens and confiscate their land rovers all because the vehicles <SPECIAL> meet stringent epa guidelines . i believe homeland security started under dubya did it not . see i could go point-by-point but you are missing the point . i can list a thousand things from anti-sodomy laws to hundreds of attempts to ban abortion ban women from removing dead fetuses georgia banning the use of certain birth controls excessive jail time generally for minorities bans on gay marriage etc etc . i m not claiming liberals are n't big government . i m just saying tea partiers are just as big govt . just different big govt . under tea partyism corporations and straight white fake christian males will see increased freedom and less government . everyone else will see much much more government and far less freedom .

armauld	clzkp44	1415729989	. i love how you never answer your own deep statements . you just let the mystery hang in the air . what is a scotsman and what is a christian . just wanting to use either name makes it okay for anything . there is no way someone can act in the polar opposite of christianity . there is no way someone can invalidate themselves with their behavior . why do i suspect that if i start calling myself an atheist while spreading the word of god a zillion furious atheists will come down on me and no one will care about scotsmen anymore . is it possible that because you are no longer christian that you like christianity being slandered .
armauld	ckk30bx	1410892537	. i am a woman and i do n't underestimate anything . i can find birth control but why should i have to accept being stolen from . male and female employees pay into a work plan it s part of our salaries . men receive all the pharmaceuticals they need including viagra for single men or rogaine etc . meanwhile women pay every bit as much as men but do n't get our pharmaceuticals fully covered for someone else s crappy fake morality . it s discrimination and it s theft .

armauld	ck812bq	1409755627	. of course i see the difference but do n't argue that it s skill . it s just a different skill set there are two year diploma programs for both daycare and it neurosurgery is a different league . the point is that there s this assumption that when a job is done mainly by women suddenly it s easy and safe . when my friend drives a mine truck lives are on the line . when my sons daycare workers take 15 kids on a 45 minute walk to the pool lives are on the line . one of those people makes 30 an hour one makes 12 .

armauld	ckwlt2i	1412093495	. christians are no longer supposed to follow the old testament . we are supposed to read it respect it carry away any valuable lessons but we are supposed to follow wholly and only the two rules laid down by jesus christ love god with your whole heart soul and being . love your neighbor . gay people are our neighbors . jesus would have befriended gay people first he would have loved them with all his heart like he did with the whores and tax collectors . then once a warm and safe relationship was developed he would have shared his message of love and hope . there is no christ in the right-wing s christianity . it s a bastardized form of judaism with just a dash of paul .

unkorrupted	cmaqrwv	1416763482	. what is this the market you speak of if not a series of government grants and privileges . without the treasury honoring the federal reserve s obligations there is no the market . you want competing currencies . get a time machine and go west . we tried it . it sucked . every other day another bank went bust and took a whole bunch of worthless currency and overhyped bullion promises with it . turns out private sector currency manipulation makes keynesian governments look like boyscouts . so we tried to print all our own public currency at the federal level and that did n't work so well either . well a big part of the problem was that we ended up in the middle of a crazy civil war so maybe we should also remember that two governments operating with purely public and purely fiat currencies were able to raise the largest industrial-era armies the world had ever seen . just imagine if they had skipped the war and gone straight to building railroads . but alas the public currency died at the demands of the british financiers who made loans to our shattered republic in the aftermath of destruction . they insisted we abandon our current corporate regulations to adopt their concepts of limited liability and government sponsored cartels that evolved directly from the hereditary privileges of those aristocrats chartered to do the crown s royal business . upon securing favorable loan and regulatory terms with the u.s congress they funneled huge sums of cash to rockefeller morgan and other would-be barons who could successfully corner and monopolize essential industries . today we make similar demands of developing countries who want financial assistance and we love to find favored investment firms that can consolidate a nation s wealth . the restoration of the financial nobility s control over america was set to be codified in 1913 but there was just one fatal flaw in the federal reserve system it was too effective . by 1929 consolidation of the nation s wealth and inequality had reached such a peak that it made 1850 s slave plantations look like a bunch of egalitarian hippy communes . but a strong economy ca n't exist unless a lot of people have discretionary income when you consolidate all of the country s capital no one has anything left to spend . sure you can build an incredible palace here or there but the rest of the economy collapses and you end up with pissed off peasants at blair mountain or something . so we came up with one more solution in the 1940s . it was incredible . it put every other innovation to shame . we kept the effectiveness and price stability of the federal reserve system but we stripped it of the rich-right wing wasp conspiracy to get as fucking rich as possible and fuck everyone else by recovering a large part of the profits of those who were most able to manipulate it for their own benefit . we took that money and we built transportation networks and schools that were the envy of the world . and you know what happened next . those kids growing up in those schools grew up to know a lot of stuff about how to build stuff and make even more money . the economy boomed . we went to the goddamn moon . since then . well a lot of the banks attached to those old names chase-rockefeller jp morgan goldman sachs well they own everything again . the economy s shit . the peasants are getting pissed off and they ll probably only continue blaming the muslims for so long .

unkorrupted	ckn2qva	1411159135	. we all pay a bunch of taxes so the important thing to watch is the total incidence of taxation not argue about who pays more for this or that for one particular levy . at the federal level taxation is fairly progressive through the poor and working classes it flattens out at the professional level but then starts to fall again when you get to the very top . at the top 400 households the 0.00012 the effective federal incidence of taxation is similar to the households making median income of about 50,000 . when combined with the monetary advantages of privatized central banking these low tax rates and privileges create a feedback loop that no one can really compete with . it s a ratcheting cycle of acquisition consolidation and monopoly that is not limited to corporate dominance because politicians and whole political parties can be purchased just as easily . in 72 years at this rate the 400 families with controlling shares of the too big to fail banks will own everything and 99.9999 of the population will live in debt . doctors lawyers engineers whatever . there will be no way to escape it short of revolution . there is no market-based solution to this problem because it is fundamentally a problem with the monetary system that can only be fixed with political modification to said system including but not limited to taxation and policies of redistribution of that cash the government helps the elite create .

shadowbanmeplz	chdtqev	1399659708	. a government union is a completely different proposition than a private sector union . forcing government employees to contribute our tax money to political action to figure out how to increase that tax money is the equivalent of the fox guarding the henhouse . a private sector union is always held in check by a business that wants to make money and is a proven workable pattern regardless of what the republicans have to say about private sector unions . private sector unions are great and they should be protected within reason of course . bottom line government unions are a form of government employee collusion against the american tax payer and should be banned .

Stooby	cge5yxx	1396018797	. both parties will shift in the direction of the voting public over time . the candidates themselves may not shift but the candidates that the party backs in the future will shift in the direction of the voting public . that is why politicians have gone further and further right over the last 3 decades . the voting public has shifted further and further right . democrat candidates have to be further and further right to even have a chance at winning . if the voting public pushes further and further left than both parties will shift that direction over time to maximize their chance of staying in power .

Stooby	ceped7b	1389721091	. without labor capital does nothing . in a perfect world it would n't be adversarial . what is good for one will tend to be good for the other . if workers make more workers will spend more . if owners make more they will invest providing more opportunity for workers . that is n't how the real world works though . right now the us is too skewed in favor of the owners over the workers . it needs to be tilted back in the other direction to approach some sort of equilibrium .
Stooby	chbuzss	1399475415	. no that is not a good analogy . it is like your boss telling you to put down the tps reports and instead work on the oxy reports because the tps reports are n't important and will be phased out anyway . if you continue working on the tps reports you are indeed being insubordinate .
Stooby	cfjmpy5	1392851047	. so you ca n't find any evidence that this is the case so you will fall back on america is exceptional . it will work here because americans are the best . this is incorrect . you are supporting a policy that would threaten millions of peoples lives based on a whim with no data to back it up . current charity provided by americans is a drop in the bucket compared to the cost of our social safety nets . what evidence do you have that charity will increase by enough to cover the costs . you are talking about toying with the welfare of millions so i would assume you have some numbers to back up your belief rather than just spouting off ridiculous platitudes . additionally what evidence do you have that the charity provided will go to helping the poor . people give to lots of charities for lots of reasons . many of those charities are n't to help the poor . they are for research proselytizing paying their pastor/bishop/etc etc . i can tell you this even if you double the amount of money given by americans to charity and it all went to helping the poor in america it still would n't be close to the cost of the social safety net .
Stooby	cht55rj	1401289400	. most likely within the next decade . they are all old . even if they do n't want to retire they wo n't live forever . scalia kennedy ginsburg and breyer will all be in their late 80s or early 90s by the time the next president hits the end of his/her second term . for the record that is two nominated by democrats and two nominated by republicans . the next president is going to be given the ability to drastically shape the long term future of this country . considering the fact that they will get 2-4 nominations and their nominations will likely sit on the bench for 30 years .
Stooby	ch6b9py	1398892781	. the democrats have managed some feats despite the obstinance of the house republicans . still the status quo is better than not having the senate . the democrats have some supreme court seats they would like to fill soon . without the senate the dems will have to roll the dice on winning the 2016 election before liberal justices will feel safe retiring ginsburg is already 81 and breyer is 75 . that would be a huge issue if liberal justices got replaced by conservative justices further skewing the balance of power in the supreme court .
Stooby	chbvfv2	1399476368	. no you are adding unnecessary fluff . obviously in the analogy the tps reports would be part of the job that is why she was working on them in the first place . he is n't being insubordinate because he has the power to dictate how his people spend their time at work . sure the company lists tps reports as a work product they create but the investors do n't want time and money wasted on tps reports . the board of directors is too useless to change the website so the ceo decides to stop creating the tps reports . in any event the public is the presidents boss and where he derives his authority . the public by a vast majority that grows every quarter wants marijuana enforcement ended . the president is within his power to end enforcement of the law so he has listened to his bosses and ended enforcement . obviously the optimal scenario is the law is changed however you could n't get the congress to agree the earth is round at this point in time . so the choice is to do nothing or do something . it is a good idea to do something .
Stooby	cj5ll8o	1406134636	. yeah it can easily keep you from getting a job . most places where you will have responsibility for handling money will perform a credit check . additionally if you ever needed to get a security clearance you would probably be denied since the government assumes people with bad credit are less responsible and more easily bribed . good news is you can get it removed from your credit report 7 years after it went delinquent .

Stooby	cfr3psm	1393612341	. you see when you have generations of children raised in poverty their whole family is also pretty much in poverty . they do n't have lots of good role models to help them out . that is pretty much the point of this program . to give them good role models . since blacks and hispanics are much more likely to end up living in poverty . and you say it is just a matter of choosing to not live in poverty . you are implicitly implying the things i said in my first paragraph . how else do you reconcile your belief with the data . are black and hispanic individuals dumber and less capable of making good decisions than white people . that seems to be what you are implying .
Stooby	cf346nq	1391123798	. yeah it has problems but it has also solved other problems . now a smaller group of people is getting fucked . hopefully we can negotiate new legislation so an even smaller group of people is getting fucked . and so on and so forth until the problem is solved .
Stooby	cemcd2b	1389382068	. unfortunately as far as i am aware medical debt tends to have better paperwork retention than credit card debt . it is really easy to dispute credit card debt . i would dispute your first sentence . do n't pay a junk debt buyer but many debt collection agencies are just contracted to try to collect the debt rather than having purchased the debt .
Stooby	cfognyg	1393353766	. you do n't understand the scope of such an application . and trivializing it by calling it a website is propaganda . it is n't just a website . it is a massive application with an enormous set of requirements and business rules that has to interface with multiple other government and private systems that most likely lack any standards . and less than 4 years is n't enough time . i do n't know when the contract was awarded but it is n't a quick process to award a government contract . then the winning team had to ramp up and elicit requirements . the requirements shifted over the course of development . it is a massive system that has to accommodate potentially millions of records in the database so database design would be non-trivial . and considering the scope you are probably dedicating several months to testing the final delivery . they were definitely very crunched for time .

Stooby	cfr44bd	1393613172	. what are you saying then . tell me why black and hispanic kids are much more likely to end up living in poverty . the data proves this is true . why is this the case . this program is about equalizing opportunity . white people already have more opportunity on average as is proven by the data . the purpose of this program is to help black and hispanic kids get to the point where they have that same opportunity .
Stooby	cflcvoy	1393020937	. are they supposed to just go to college for free if they dropped out . that just means everyone that succeeds in college has higher interest rates to pay for the drop outs that had their loans forgiven . if you go to an expensive college and rack up tons of debt and do n't end up in a career that can pay for that debt you pretty much screwed yourself over . i do n't know how we can fix this .

Stooby	cflb4eu	1393017202	. this is certainly a problem . they would have to rely on scholarships and charity . they should make the yearly caps based on major more restrictive . if that poor kid wants to become an engineer he can borrow 15,000 per year . if he wants to be a music major he can borrow 5,000 per year . it lowers the amount of loan money available to kids while still allowing it for degrees that will probably be able to afford it upon graduation .

Stooby	cflcl86	1393020293	. you have paid off your loans . your help does n't come from a lower interest rate on the student loans you no longer pay on . if you have problems that you need help with that are n't related to student loans you should probably be in a thread for those problems talking about getting help .
Stooby	clomktw	1414708753	. unlikely to be the case since people performing studies searching for voter fraud were unable to find them . and a large systemic voting fraud ring like that would be hard to conceal . additionally the benefit is still not worth the risk . if the election has 100,000 votes cast you would need 1,000 to even sway the election 1 . that means you have gotten 1,000 fraudulent registrations through then manage to actually go out and cast 1,000 fraudulent votes . it is easier to lose ballots while going from the poll to where they are counted or rig the count or just disenfranchise people .

Stooby	cesxtyc	1390082526	. because one side is demanding cuts that target the poor and the other side is doing everything they can to minimize those to stop the bleeding . the republicans will do everything they can to avoid the economy improving under obama because if that happens they will lose the next presidential election . food stamps are good for the economy so they will attack them . unemployment is good for the economy so they will attack it . they will prevent the government from doing anything until they get the cuts they want . all the dems can do is try to stop the bleeding . this is the problem when a party becomes fanatical . they will damage the countries future so they can win the game .
Stooby	cmdns4i	1417019579	. if the option is between investing it and risking losing most to a bad investment then even if the investment works out they pay a huge amount to the government or keeping it and it losing only a marginal amount due to inflation the best option becomes clearer . you invest only in the safest possible investments . everything else be damned . i am pretty far left but this is just the way math works . the tax rate should probably be higher on capital gains it is progressive now at least . however it is a careful balancing act .
Stooby	cfjm1vu	1392849738	. i think the cost of labor is n't the only thing determining the cost of a hamburger . it is a portion of it . so a portion of that cost will increase . and that portion increase will be passed onto the consumer but even if the wage is increased 40 the increase cost per burger is going to be a reasonable 5-10 not 40 . this means the poor people who work there and might want to take home some for work get to do so for less of their take home income than they would have before . despite costs increasing slightly . yes increasing minimum wage will very slightly increase cost of living but it is n't as drastic as the naysayers claim . people falsely assume increasing the cost of labor will increase the cost of products by the same amount and this is obviously false because the cost of a product is only partially caused by the cost of labor . historically minimum wage increases have not caused all the doom and gloom naysayers predict . typically they are good for the economy as a bunch of people that have no choice but to spend every penny they take in are taking home more pennies .
Stooby	chjnmag	1400261274	. i agree those qualify him for a nutjob in my book too but in the grand political scheme he is in between moderate right and tea party . a lot of gop candidates become hugely popular among leftists just because they do n't completely parrot the gop talking points . ron paul mania started because he was the only gop candidate in the debates that supported ending the war in iraq . people fell in love with him based solely on that and their passion led them to support positions that they would have previously considered ridiculous just because they supported ron paul . i knew people that went from socialist to libertarians based solely on their adoration for ron paul because he was controversial in a gop debate . it is weird how that works . they see him disagree with the party on a few topics and then they start ascribing leftist ideologies on him and before too long they have to shift their own ideologies or face cognitive dissonance and admit they have been telling everyone how much they love a candidate that is further right than the candidates they hate . huntsman played the same card . he did n't agree with the other gop candidates on civil unions or the war in afghanistan and as a result leftists fell in love with him . fortunately the fervor is n't quite the same as it was for ron paul .
Stooby	cfqzx6n	1393604108	. no they are poor and lack opportunities but they are a minority of young white males . when you look at black and hispanic young males there is a much larger percent of them in those conditions . so you create programs to try and equalize . there will always be poor people with less opportunities of every race . the problem is the ratio in white population vs black population vs hispanic population is out of whack . all things being equal you would expect the ratio to be similar but it is n't because all things are n't equal .
Stooby	cfr5ax1	1393615578	. you do n't seem to understand the fact that the percentage of white people that face these hardships is much lower than the percentage of black and hispanic people that face these hardships . the goal of this program is to reduce those percentages for black and hispanic people to provide equality .

BenvolioMontague	ciq62ae	1404686924	. gt because the economy has really had an impact on how low-wage employers give hours . yes . it does . if the economy is doing well and the business is doing well then they can afford to expand and provide employees with more hours . i do n't see how you can argue against this . gt because if the economy suddenly ramps up it will then become my choice how many hours i work . in a sense it is . if the economy is good and there are plenty of jobs and your first employer is only giving you 20 hour work days then why the fuck would n't you just take up a second job . or ask your employer for more hours . my parents used to own an ice cream shop and they were always open for discussion with their employees about something like that . gt when the choice to work is in the hands of the employee when is it not . if jobs are available then you have a choice to work or not . gt then you can say that poverty is a choice and not be a complete ass . well since it is in the hands of the worker i will be saying yes it is your choice at least partially to be in poverty . i m not saying everyone that is in poverty is in it by choice . especially not now with how shitty the economy is but what i am saying is that for many people it is poverty by choice . gt until then you re a complete ass for saying it . go demand 40 hours a week from a fast food place see where that gets you . ha be mad i do n't really give two fucks . me being an ass has nothing to do with whether or not i m right . i d rather be an asshole and be right than not be an asshole and be wrong . and i would n't demand anything from my employer i would ask . but all of this is irrelevant . you re completely missing the point . the average family in poverty works the same amount of hours whether or not the economy is good or bad . how can they possibly not be able to find better or more jobs when the economy is good . you ca n't honestly sit there and tell me that the amount of and quality of jobs is the same whether or not the economy is good . gt it s obvious that if you ever did work in such a job that it was n't anytime within the past decade . shit just does n't work like that . when there are 40hour/week jobs we have high unemployment and the only reason it s down to 6 now is because all the employers are hiring people for 10-20hour schedules and making one job into two . you re really trying to argue that 40 hour work week jobs is what causes high unemployment . gt poverty is not a choice . anyone who thinks it is is way way way fucking removed from the reality of poverty . but most of it is you have n't even really argued for this position throughout your post . you kind of just bitched at me called me an asshole and then said that high unemployment is caused by 40 hour a week jobs which has nothing to do with what we re talking about since the average poor family will still be working the same amount of hours a year despite how good or bad the economy is . how does any of what you wrote even support let alone prove your assertion that poverty is the us is not by choice . furthermore no i have n't ever been in poverty . my family has always been middle class . but how does that have anything to do with it . are you saying you have to had experienced poverty in order to talk about it . to understand what causes it . does the doctor have to have disease xyz in order to cure it on someone else . no of course not . basically your entire post was shit you said nothing to support your main assertion and you did nothing to refute mine .

BenvolioMontague	cg51hvd	1395089898	. gt i said before i m not making an absolute argument here and you went ahead and made one . no my argument would be more like that a gini coefficient score of 25 is more ideal to social and wealth equality than 45 . the gini coefficient is extremely limited in what it measures but sure whatever . there s nothing wrong with wanting less income inequality but you have to look at it in the full picture . not just income itself . gt concentration of wealth is bad for a people who say they are free and herald liberty and justice as the foundation of their principles and virtue . history books show this time and again regardless of the form of government or economics . why is concentration of wealth inherently bad . gt look at the industrial barons and how they treated people in the late 1800 s and early 1900 s . tell me it was just or fair . oh you mean guys like andrew carnegie who came here dirt poor amassed a fortune by providing products and services that enriched people s lives as well as providing people with jobs . not to mention the countless universities libraries etc . that the robber barons created out of their own pocket for the public good . did i mention that andrew carnegie went as far as creating large pension funds for his employees . furthermore the robber barons are horrible as opposed to what exactly . living on the farm and working all day outside and in the elements . potentially starving to death if you have a bad year for crops . not being able to pursue anything else because you have to have food . yeah i never hear that side of the story whenever the left complains about something . x is bad but opposed to what .
BenvolioMontague	cmjqjw4	1417591845	. i wo n't argue with your first point . gt as a side note your argument also ignores the physical development of the brain . technically it s not even done fully growing\developing until year 25 or so . and alcohol inhibits the proper development of brains . so your guns vs beer analogy really is n't applicable . alcohol is objectively more damaging to a teen than to a full adult and that s a fact of biology . your point is moot as you point out the fact that the brain does n't stop developing until 25 . if that s what the law was actually about the drinking age would be 25 . furthermore you re arguing for a position in which the solution for the above problem is to use the threat of violence to stop it . the judge basically told me that he d be willing to have someone put a gun to my head and force me into a cage for 90 days because i had a few beers when i was twenty for a first offense . if it would have been in any other setting i would have considered that a serious threat and taken physical action against him in order to protect myself . i do n't see working in the military as service in any way whatsoever . it s just a job but one that i happen to have wanted to do since i was a child . the way the cops and court treated me has made me hate both the system and those that work within it . it makes me extremely angry that there are people in this country willing to commit violence against me for something that harms no one but myself and there is no ethical defense for that . i was n't driving i did n't have the ability to drive as i did n't even transport myself there in the first place and i was n't causing a ruckus in public . furthermore the federal government basically bullies the states into making the drinking age at least 21 by withholding highway funding if they do n't . the only reason it was deemed constitutional is that they would only withhold 10 of the funding . that excuse does n't fly for me . also i would argue shooting is a more dangerous activity than drinking . it would require years of drinking heavily to damage my mind and body to the degree that one mishap with a firearm can do in the fraction of a second .

BenvolioMontague	cfihd8n	1392748331	. that s quite the revisionist history . up until the 1930s there was very little government involvement in the economy . the majority of what little interference that occurred was due to government corruption rather than attempting to use government in a way that was extending its original role . sure if you want to split hairs technically it was never a pure capitalist system but that is just being asinine . there has never been any pure system on the level of the state . and there were tons of technological medicinal and scientific advances before the government began funding research for these things .

GetToDaChoppa1	cl1vivk	1412605431	. capitalism as an ideology is free of prejudice . it is inherently unbiased . the racism sexism and xenophobia that you perceive are definitely the result of external factors influencing the ways in which capitalism is practiced . racism sexism and xenophobia are all the result of humans discriminating against one another . they are products of society not capitalism . read up on some foucauldian discourse analysis and you ll see what i mean . . this has nothing to do with capitalism . this is just an ideological contradiction . gt capitalism has no qualms with systemic exclusion of american citizens without a trial . this is fundamentally undemocratic . what does a right to a trial have to do with any of this . systemic economic exclusion and habeas corpus are totally seperate concepts you do n't have a right to a trial simply because you are excluded from the economy . capitalism is inherently democratic . capitalism forces one to make the best with what they have that is totally consistent with the concept of democracy . the inequalities that we see in society are not so much a result of the failures of capitalism as they are the result of the systemic political neglect of communities who need help the most . wealth and income inequality is not necessarily the result of capitalism as inequality was extremely low when the highest marginal income tax levels were higher see eisenhower jfk nixon ford . the wealth and income inequality that we see today is the direct result of the failed tax and economic policies of reagan and republicans like him . i m as liberal as the next guy but i also admit that capitalism has created more opportunity than any other economic system possibly could . the inequality that we see in our society is not a result of the failure of capitalism but the failure of politicians to implement it in such a way that does not promote rapid economic inequality .

GetToDaChoppa1	cl8hmej	1413230052	. these are two different situations in the eyes of the judicial system . a voter-id requirement which necessitates acquiring possibly multiple forms of id traveling spending money and locating a dmv or equivalent for voting is an unnecessary burden upon your inalienable right to vote and therefore should n't be required . traveling to a polling station however is the responsibility of the voter . as long as the polling station is reasonably accessible then it is the responsibility of the voter to travel to it . as long as there exists no barrier or unnecessary burden when arriving at the polling station which should be reasonably accessible it is constitutionally permissible .
GetToDaChoppa1	cl1zlzj	1412614130	. gt that s debatable . i m not aware of any capitalist system that has n't promoted economic inequality . right inherent in capitalism is inequality . but this inequality can be curbed which is why i am a democrat . i believe that the government can and should curb the inequality which is brought about by capitalism . but inequality in itself is by no means a sufficient basis to do away with the most beneficial economic system ever devised . instead we should elect democrats who promote common-sense regulation and higher taxes to promote economic equality . gt i know one is a system of governance while the other is of economics but i seriously doubt we ll ever see a capitalist society divested from economic inequality no capitalist society will ever be 100 free of poverty . however look at the united states during the 1950s inequality in the united states was at an all-time low . it was incredible really . then reagan came along and fucked everything up . it is possible to have a capitalist society with low income inequality . europe has done fairly well with it . gt at some point you have to look at the system itself . you praise capitalism for the opportunity it provides but wo n't lay any blame on it for the bads that arise and flourish in its presence . i never said anything about capitalism not having flaws . people keep putting words in my mouth . i merely addressed capitalism and prejudice and capitalism not being democratic . capitalism certainly does have flaws . inherent in it is inequality i do n't like that . still i do n't believe that this is a sufficient basis to toss capitalism out and to devise a new economic system . capitalism has created more wealth than prosperity than any other system in human history . it has created opportunities for millions if not billions of people around the world . that being said human beings need to be better at managing capitalism and curbing its negative effects i.e . excessive greed monopolies inequality etc . though it is n't perfect no economic system truly is . still believe that capitalism is the best economic system available .

Veylis	cmcxbuq	1416948191	. gt you re trying to assert that he stole the cigarellos that s an entirely separate claim than whether or not the store asserted that he did . the store owner did n't call the police . that does n't mean the store owner is not aware he stole the cigars . he probably just knew from experience that calling the police over a theft ends up being a waste of time . gt the video shows that he paid for at least some of them no it does not show this . it is grainy and the shit in brown s hand is more likely more cigars not the fantasy cash he was going to pay with . gt and in any event the store had exactly nothing to do with the shooting . absolutely exactly precisely nothing . officer wilson had no awareness at all of it annnd here we have another moron that has not read the grand jury evidence . gt since this whole cigarello-theft is being pointed to as proof-positive that brown was a dastardly criminal could n't be all of the overwhelming evidence that brown assaulted a cop and went for his gun that makes me think he is a criminal . no it must only be his robbery video .

Veylis	cij8t7n	1403954750	. this still does n't make any sense . if the fbi has no evidence you were making the amount they claim then they have no case . it s like you are saying the fbi can say this guy killed 3 women if he can not produce the women alive then the court will automatically find him guilty of murder with no other evidence other than the fbi claim .

Veylis	cg6mz73	1395250508	. that is n't what i am saying . the cost of education in the us has gotten completely out of hand . the issue is complex and probably needs some major regulation to fix . however some sort of blanket pay 10 of your income for life idea is silly . student loans falling from the sky has caused colleges to jack up tuition costs to absurd highs . that problem is the one we need to tackle . not figuring out even more ways to bloat the number of kids lining up to pay out of control tuition costs .

Veylis	cgi4y8x	1396448255	. gt compared to the plan i had last year that was cancelled that was 100 a month this is the thing that is difficult to discuss without us comparing paperwork . i find it very hard to believe you had a plan covering you and a child for 100 a month especially if not offered by an employer . gt and covered 80 of medical . 80 of what exactly . 80 of the healthcare cost not going to a deductible . once again at 100 a month with a child it is just very difficult to believe this . gt i replied to someone about this here . i think you may be taking this out of context . that clause was in response to people flipping out about their super cheap garbage plans being canceled for not meeting aca minimums . one exception grandfathered individual health insurance plans the only exception is for grandfathered individual health insurance plans the kind you buy yourself not through an employer . they do not have to cover pre-existing conditions . if you have one of these plans you can switch to a marketplace plan during open enrollment and immediately get coverage for your pre-existing conditions . what is a grandfathered plan a group health plan that was <SPECIAL> an individual health insurance policy that was <SPECIAL> or before march 23 2010 . grandfathered plans are exempted from many changes required under the affordable care act . plans or policies may lose their <SPECIAL> status if they make certain significant changes that reduce benefits or increase costs to consumers . a health plan must disclose in its plan materials whether it considers itself to be a grandfathered plan and must also advise consumers how to contact the u.s department of labor or the u.s department of health and human services with questions . gt not for the ones i ve looked at . the plans i ve looked at cost more than the plan i had before obamacare once again without knowing a lot of details this is impossible to judge . i hear a ton of these stories yet when specifics are offered rarely they never seem to add up . gt i d say that maybe obama had good intentions when he started on reforming healthcare obama would have preferred a single payer system . unfortunately this is politically impossible due to massive obstruction by republicans . even though the aca is essentially their plan they are now fighting it tooth and nail simply because obama proposed it . gt but in the end the benefits are certainly not outweighed by the increase in costs and the decreases in coverage . unless we can sit down with your old insurance plan details i suppose we can not settle this . i will say what you are saying makes no sense from everything i have seen regarding the aca .

Veylis	ch7qg7e	1399040711	. it s like you just did n't even read my post . having bulk meta data so that it can be computer sifted for relevant connections to targets is not a dossier on americans nor is it spying on americans . this is the very definition of incidental collection which is why not wittingly is an appropriate response . if the nsa could not bear to incidentally ingest even one byte of a us citizens data they would be completely unable to function as a signit agency . if these wild stretches of what spying on americans is are the case against the nsa color me unimpressed .

Veylis	cj2n9dc	1405875622	. gt i think most people are not upset on the grounds of legality . i believe most of the upset is people who believe parts or all of the program should not be legal i think the main problem especially on reddit is that people have major misconceptions about what the nsa does . the leak stories are spun to imply that all of the programs leaked are used domestically when no evidence shows they are . makes me feel like im arguing with jello when people do n't even understand the basic facts of the issue . gt and this was not an accident . it s telling that james clapper lied on the stand about i this is another reddit trope that gets really old . clapper did not lie . . i agree and i would be the first one screaming if i felt the meta data program was being abused . so far it has not been demonstrated that it is . the other programs are not even used domestically but you would n't know that from reading reddit . greenwald has made great pains to imply they are and rightly assume no one actually reads the raw linked documents .

elsparkodiablo	cfpd540	1393441081	. because human beings do n't have claws horns or razor sharp teeth . people need to be able to defend themselves against larger stronger more numerous attackers . you seem to have this impression that guns make the world worse . they do n't . life before guns had vast armies of people dying at the point of swords or pikes or with bows and arrows . people were chattel and women were property and life was ugly brutish and short .

elsparkodiablo	ch47j00	1398701711	. saying it s not necessarily accurate is equivocation at best . sure if you think anti-gun means banning all guns it s not necessarily accurate but when you look at the outright ignorance displayed by the anti-gun side and the pride in that ignorance it becomes clear that the shrill champions are indeed anti-gun . by and large however anti-gun people are for banning at least some type of firearm whichever is the one in the news at the time seems to be the standard . the nearest comparison is abortion rights only in this case the pro-gun side is pro-choice and the anti-gun side is a bunch of zealots who are reaching jihad levels of irrationality . nobody is forcing people to go out and buy a gun . the pro-gun groups want people to be able to determine their own need of self protection or even hobby use . the anti-gun people think somehow that abstinence only is an effective form of education and engage on quixotic quests to ban guns like assault weapons that are n't a statistical threat . it s emotion amp ignorance vs common sense and unfortunately the for the children . side has much more money .

elsparkodiablo	chaxtm4	1399386098	. gt based on the death threats the rockville store got it feels like gun rights activists are trying to ban smart guns be careful about painting with a broad brush . if you said that based on crime rates all black men are criminals we d rightly call you a racist . same if you claimed that all muslims are terrorists . saying that gun rights activists are trying to ban smart guns is not indicative of the nra s position in the slightest . gt let me ask you should we fight for the right for people to own smart guns or should we fight to ban them . i say that the market should decide without government interference . mandating people buy smartguns is no different than poll taxes or literacy tests prior to voting it s just a hoop to make people jump through in order to discourage the undesirables .

elsparkodiablo	chdud7k	1399661030	. gt car accidents kill a lot of people but if we did n't have vehicles our economy would more or less collapse not to mention the enormous inconvenience to everyone . car accidents kill a lot of people and wound millions of others . you do n't need a car a bus or train is plenty . for that matter given america s obesity epidemic it d help more people if they d walk . sure we can make exemptions for farmers or people who live in rural areas but you do n't need a car you want a car . gt if we had strict gun laws that only allowed you to have one gun for self-defense the only negative effect would be that you would n't get to carry on you hobby of collecting guns . sure i agree . let s mandate that everyone be issued one ea of the standard infantry rifle and sidearm along with a basic fighting load of ammunition . if you want more than that show that you have the commensurate skills for example if you want a hunting rifle you pass a basic marksmanship test and the government will hand you a free remington m40x or sasr . win win great idea u/nj500 . gt also let s keep in mind that vehicles are very highly regulated . we regulate who can drive . we require them to take driver s ed . we require them to pass a driver s test . we required them to have a license and to wear corrective lenses if their vision is n't good enough . we require them to register their vehicles and get them inspected each year . we restrict the types of vehicles that a person can drive . we regulated specifically how they must drive the vehicles . we require all driver s to carry liability insurance . are you okay with us having regulations this strict for guns too . that s substantially less regulation than guns face . for example there s no prohibition of felons owning cars you can literally kill someone with a car today and retain your cars throughout your prison stay and be driving again the day you get out . on top of that there s no federal background check for purchasing cars from dealers nor are car dealers subject to federal inspections to the point of hefty fines and prison terms if they sell a car to someone . in addition there s no age restrictions to buying cars gas tank or passenger capacity limits or even a speed governor you can buy a high-capacity assault van right now or a fully automatic sports car capable of going 200mph . so really if you want to regulate guns like cars you are talking about really loosening up the existing restrictions . are you ok with that .
elsparkodiablo	cmwxtc2	1418765487	. nope you stated outright that gt social benefit provided by private usage of firearms is as far as i know completely negligible . clearly that s not the case . self defense is a social benefit so either you are wrong or you are lying feel free to choose . if you think that self defense offers no social benefit then that is a pretty clear case of confirmation bias as no amount of convincing will change your opinion .

elsparkodiablo	cfrjlyj	1393651431	. gt the study does n't address how guns effect street violence i ca n't find a citation but i seem to remember reading having a gun in your house greatly increases your chance of being killed by a family member but the aggregate effect on homicides is hard to dispute . considering that 2/3rds of firearms deaths in america are suicides it might be something to investigate . this article . too be fair there are also a few papers that have been released that also show no reduction in crime for other areas . what s particularly interesting though is that no papers found an increase in crime corresponding to concealed carry reform when the data was expanded to show long term effects . in other words it s been shown that more guns less crime or more guns same crime but there s no evidence that more guns more crime which is valuable information indeed . this is bolstered by the ever increasing amounts of firearms purchasing evidenced by consistent trends in rising nics checks since 1994 and falling crime rates nation wide throughout the same time period . again though correlation causation .
elsparkodiablo	ch49spq	1398706378	. gt there are plenty of moderate people who get lumped in with the anti-gun side but the debate is just too polarized in this country to get any kind of moderate gun regulation or deregulation passed . we do n't need further gun regulation passed we ve went past the happy medium a long time ago . it s only with recent supreme court cases like heller amp mcdonald that we re starting to swing the pendulum back towards a balance and even then nobody s talking about disposing of all regulations . if the anti-gun politicians were serious about crime reduction they would have been happy with the coburn amendment when manchin-toomey was shot down . instead they voted in lockstep against it because it was n't extreme enough for them . they made perfect the enemy of good .

elsparkodiablo	chb1vft	1399395253	. gt there are lots of articles about smart guns on that site all of them negative . you do n't need to be sherlock holmes to be able to figure out that they do n't want them in market . it s freaking nra lobby site . so the articles are negative against current iterations of smartguns for good reason and against existing smart gun law for good reason but not a blanket condemnation of smartguns as a concept nor advocating a ban against them . thanks for clearing that up . gt i hate to quote myself from my last post but here goes you can keep it charged with kinetic energy you can run a wrist watch with a kinetic energy and it takes way more power than a simple short range radio frequency pulse . gt when you carry a gun with you it moves thus charging the battery . not really . wrist watches generate kinetic energy because they are worn on the wrist and the wrist swings them back and forth . firearms are typically carried in a holster on the body not an extremity . furthermore most home defense firearms are n't carried on a daily basis they are stationary either in a drawer closet or safe . how much shaking and movement will be needed to charge up the battery . i ve owned a number of kinetic watches btw . if i left them sitting around for a day i d have to wind them up again before they d work . not something i d feel safe with for a firearm that i might need to protect my life . gt i imagined it this way the passive tag is implanted in your hand/you wear it on ring or bracelet or something and when you squeeze the grip the active part in the gun sends the pulse . so in your scenario both require an active power supply . either the gun is going to have to constantly send out interrogation signals is there a tag near . no . is there a tag near . no . is there a tag near . no . is there a tag near . yes disarm which will eat up battery life see push messaging on your smartphone or the firearm sensor will be passive in listen mode until it needs to disarm which still requires some amount of physical safety disengagement . either solution requires power . gt but unlike you i think it s completely possible to build one that is reliable . oh it s possible . just not in time to prevent nj from disarming non-smartgun owning citizens and we re several generations away from one that can handle full power cartridges and has a battery life measured in years not days . whether or not it can be disarmed by a thief or other unauthorized user is another matter .

aquaponibro	cfvcer5	1394059201	. the estimate regarding the decrease in employment is a very conservative estimate more like the upper-bound . it is conceivable that there is a golden minimum wage for any given economy which could actually bring employment to the natural rate by lowering private debt of individuals with high mpc while raising their income and fueling a keynesian style stimulus . there is some theoretical literature which backs up this idea but econ tends to move from orthodoxy slowly . right now we are debating if minimum wage hurts employment . in the future we will be arguing if it helps it .

farkdog	cf12glq	1390932634	. it s shocking to me that a gay person would work so hard for the gop . the gop got in bed with the religious nuts years ago and now they are a significant part of the party . they dominate the party . now they are stuck with a minority of wingnuts that are weighing them down like a millstone around their neck . but even without this the gop is not a party of small government . the gop is the party of manipulate government to serve the interests of the wealthy . so priority number one is making sure that all the industries involved in supporting the military keep running full bore . keeping up the war on drugs likewise is a big money maker for all the associated industries .
farkdog	cjbb13y	1406663964	. i think there is an important lesson here . you can not install democracy nor an appreciation for freedom . a people have to yearn for freedom and then see a democratic government as a tool to set people free . when a people accept tyranny as acceptable they will simply use democracy to elect tyrants .

farkdog	ckqj97n	1411500331	. walmart sells plenty of rifles even assault rifles . i think it has more to do with the fact that they are hugely expensive and hugely unable to be concealed . all rifles combined only account for about 300 homicides in the usa every year . this is half as many as are killed by hands and feet . rifles simply are not amenable to crime which almost always is committed with the intent to escape which means subterfuge .

farkdog	cjxlw08	1408727792	. my opinion is that other minorities are typically immigrants who came here with an expectation of the availability of opportunity . in short they believed success was possible . it s why they came here . blacks have only had that opportunity by law within the last 30-50 years . and since the 1970s we have been destroying the black nuclear family with the war on drugs right through to today . so easily within living memory opportunity for many blacks was simply not a reality that could ever be achieved . it will take generations of achievement before future generations of blacks will grow up simply believing that the american dream is an achievable reality . today many blacks are simply opting out of american society because they do not believe in their heart of hearts that any other possible alternative exists for them . hopelessness kills ambition .

farkdog	cf8utnd	1391723715	. the common rebuttal to this is that this does not tell the whole story . yes the number of people who failed drug tests and lost their benefits was less of a total dollar value than the cost of the drug tests . but it does not indicate how many people did not bother applying for benefits since they knew they would not pass the drug test . what needs to also be considered is this how many fewer people applied for benefits if any after drug testing was implemented .

farkdog	cfns2sa	1393282799	. yes i hear this all the time . kids just looooove to learn . kids love to eat too . does n't mean they love to eat every food they encounter . i was a kid once too . and no matter how you dress it up sooner or later there will be academic endeavors that you just find to be a chore . it s work . and work is n't fun . that s just the way it is . i would much rather have sat around building model rockets model airplanes ride my atv play in the woods or a host of other things as a kid than learning algebra . but i had to learn algebra so when my grades went down my parents hired a tutor to come and i had to spend my afternoons at the kitchen table doing the work of learning maths . it was n't fun and no matter how fun you think you might be able to make it it probably would n't have been as fun as other ways i could have been fucking around with my time . instead it took my parents making me do the work .
farkdog	ci03ham	1401998413	. gt you are misunderstanding my point . i m not saying anything about screening people based on their reason for wanting guns . i m saying if you want to solve the problem of too much of something in a society you have to look at the reasons people want it and see if you can reduce that so people want less of it . too much of what . violence or guns . gt if we address it there over time demand for guns will go down fewer idiots will have guns and those who do have guns will have them for healthier reasons and likely be more responsible with them . no gun control needed if there s no gun culture . define gun culture . gt if human nature is violent and blah blah blah recorded history why is the us the only first world country with this problem . non-homogenous society . socioeconomic disparity makes our minorities about 7-8 times more likely to commit violent crimes than whites . gt but why is the us known for gun mania and australia has a gun ban that is working very well to prevent mass shootings like the ones we have here on a regular basis . it s obvious no guns no gun violence . gt not all cultures glorify power and violence . that is the naive appraisal that this problem is happening all over the world and all throughout history when it is unique to america . violence is hardly unique to america . in fact worldwide there are far more violent places than here . . it s human nature . just look at the box office returns for violent movies . show me a little boy who does n't play soldier .

farkdog	ciblixu	1403186933	. and let s face it this idea of an ever-increasing-bar of education to get the good jobs is not sustainable . most of the population is n't going to have the ability or desire to be rocket scientists . moreover the jobs just are n't going to need labor of any kind as automation gets better and better . if we ever develop ai all bets are off even for jobs that require thinking .
farkdog	cgzwnm7	1398263317	. yup if you get rid of all the guns you can enjoy less gun crime no doubt . however it also means that all victims of violent crime are at the mercy of anyone stronger than they are . and it means you are at the mercy of your government s benevolence .
farkdog	ckxo2b7	1412188090	. gt what if your view was that all people are a danger to you so your tool of self-defense was to kill everyone you encounter . society would also clearly have a right to prevent you from exercising it as you see fit . obviously that is an extreme example but it does illustrate the point . i am not claiming that people have the right to commit indiscriminate violence in the name of self-defense . i claim that people have the right to tools as they see fit for self-defense even if such tools can be used to commit indiscriminate violence . just because people can do bad things with guns does not mean that people should not be allowed to own them .

farkdog	ci36kkt	1402339798	. gt the discussion should ask why education is so expensive . the answer is because of all the free money available . it s just like the housing bubble . easy loans to anyone and everyone means unlimited demand which means skyrocketing housing prices . end of easy loans meant plummeting housing prices . easy student loans do the same thing to tuition prices . you have unlimited demand because everyone is told they have to go to college and there is easy money to do it .

morrison0880	chhgnpm	1400039146	. that s fine . you can believe that and still admit that obama was far from truthful in selling it to the american public . being in favor of the aca or at least the direction it went does not mean you have to defend it at every step including its path to becoming law . i will never understand that mindset . the president lied when explaining it to the public who had not yet been privy to the entire law and its consequences . even if it was by omission it was still a lie . just because someone admits that is not a knock on the aca itself .

morrison0880	cfbzpqi	1392067548	. thank you . honestly there are many jobs where the ratio is more likely the other way around depending on the industry and the location of the jobs but you are correct that the current unemployment rate is not very healthy.such a broad statement that there are three job seekers for every job does n't really hit on the nuances of the reason for this nor does it address the fact that some jobs despite the number of unemployed are unable to be filled .

morrison0880	chxpfkv	1401760415	. the only point where my tone was combative or dickish was in the above couple comments . when i m down voted for pointing out that the unions have had a big hand in the usps financial problems i m roundly down voted because it s the touch of death around here to question or criticize unions . when i point out that the 75-year pretending requirement is bulls hit i m down voted because it does n't line up with the narrative and flies in the face of what r/politics subscribers have been conditioned to believe . i m not complaining though . i know what i m getting into being a contrarian especially on this issue and if i can educate a couple of people along the way i ll take it .
morrison0880	cisqshh	1404929961	. gt it still seems pretty clear that if you randomly pick a poorer uneducated person chances are they will be voting conservatively . that s simply not true . take the population as a whole . historically the less educated you are the more likely you are to vote democrat . in 2012 obama garnered 64 of the high school drop out vote . and that in 2008 he took in 66 of the drop out vote in 2000 gore got 59 of their vote as did clinton is 1996 . interestingly the vote was split almost even between kerry and bush in 2004 . here is a good source . there are exceptions during a few elections but for the most part democrats dominate the high school dropout grade school demographic while republicans take the college educated . post-graduate do vote for democrats but i would n't call them more educated in general . just more educated in their specific field . regardless if you have n't graduated from high school you are most likely voting democrat . here s a quick chart . the same goes for the poor . you can look at the demographics from the last presidential election . you can look at the 2008 election . you can follow that trend to the 2004 election . if you are lower-middle class or lower you are most likely voting democrat .

morrison0880	cg1m6nj	1394723647	. yeah yeah . and republicans freed the slaves while democrats fought to keep them . the unions of the past are not the unions of today . unless you want to kiss the gop s ass for freeing african americans for slavery start recognizing the fact that today s union and working conditions are not the union and working conditions of the past . hell trade and labor unions tried to exclude blacks and women from not only joining unions but from being covered by the flsa . should we start condemning them for that .

tuseroni	civq4mi	1405202335	. i would have to assume if you are libertarian you would be opposed to regulation of abortions since it is regulation and to my knowledge opposing government regulation is the thing the libertarian party is all about . course they would still be in favour of banning abortions since they agree with banning some things things they do n't like . no libertarian has ever said they are against making murder illegal before you bristle i am not equating abortion and murder calm down and keep reading or theft or a good number of other things we all agree should be illegal and prosecuted . so banning abortion is in line with this ideal of government banning certain things being ok 1 but regulating it out of existence seems antithetical to libertarian ideals . i imagine since they would as soon see it banned they just kinda look the other way at regulating it out of existence . as for why they are n't as big on opposing viagra because no one has told them to . the general method for politics today is people come with a particular taste someone comes and sets a plate in front of them they say if they like it or not . if the ban viagra coverage plate is never set in front of them they never get a chance to eat it . people do not go out to find things they like or not they just wait for their plate to be put in front of them . libertarians find government regulation distasteful so when pundits stick a plate under their nose that includes government regulation they turn it away however many plates go by without ever being put under their nose . and then there are ways you can dress up a distasteful dish so that they may swallow something they would otherwise hate we call this framing . 1 to be clear i have heard some libertarians going as far as to say the government should n't even ban murder . the idea here being i have the right to murder you you have the right to murder me and we will all live in peace and harmony because no one will act irrational and murder anyone because they know everyone in omniscient and will know it was them and murder them back and everyone fears for their lives so no one will murder . the anarchist libertarians .

lxlqlxl	ch8jbxs	1399129194	. yeah they are perfectly for corporate welfare but social welfare not so much . the irony to this is that they assume giving money to business will increase jobs but the reality is that supply side does n't work and that money is more likely going to help fund laying people off and or reducing their work force and or using it to pay for stock buy backs whereas giving that single mother an extra 10-15 bucks a month could potentially create more jobs due to a higher demand in the market . the poorer you are the more the money will go toward stimulating the market . those who are more likely to spend than to save that is .
lxlqlxl	cggk367	1396285575	. gun control is a bad thing . sure i will agree an outright ban on all guns would be somewhat bad but common sense restrictions which is what she seems to be for would be ideal . most people are for background checks . she s for the ban that lapsed which was n't the best legislation at the time but it was better than nothing . although i personally see the reasoning for large capacity magazines from a lazy perspective not wanting to change clips that often but in reality if you are in a situation where you have to shoot at a person a large capacity is not going to really help any situation . i mean are you going to lay down some cover fire . or use some type of quasi military shit you see in the movies . the more bullets that are flying the more likely the odds of an innocent person being caught in the cross fire or a stray bullet . if you ca n't hit your target with 7-12 rounds then maybe reload and 7-12 more maybe you should spend a little more time at the range and improve your aim . hell even trained professionals like police are not that great at hitting their targets but still get by with less than the proposed ban . now as for being for a larger more militant police force . can you point to something specific i have not found anything that would suggest such a thing . i am not saying the violence against women act is ideal in every situation but it s better than the alternative . it s definitely moving in the right direction so it should n't necessarily be scrapped and start over . trying to get something like that done is hard enough rebuilding it would likely just make it worse . i would support changing a few things but as is again it s still better than nothing at all and with time it can be changed . i am sure if you brought up some common sense changes to her that she would be open minded enough to take a look at them and be for those changes if they made sense . now as for her being progressive i think she seems that way but it seems that way a lot more due to how far the right has pulled to the right it has artificially pulled the center to the right . if you go back to say the 90 s her rhetoric is in line with a moderate democrat of that time .
lxlqlxl	cfjqzl6	1392860067	. they completely overestimate one portion and underestimate others . sure some jobs will shift but the result should be more net jobs than less . they also assume that every bit of an increase in wages automatically translates to an increase in prices for something like 10.10 it will not have to absolutely increase the price in a lot of areas . if a business is already squeezing the margins they are not paying their executives huge sums of money and really top heavy then sure the price of the product will have to increase a bit to help cover that cost . for top heavy companies who are making a killing on profits maybe they make a little bit less . if their sectors are actually competing with other companies then raising the price that high could result in losing market share . maybe if they are all in collusion and raise their prices all together and agree to stay at that price then sure that would be possible .

lxlqlxl	ci0k6qq	1402044416	. that s doubtful and even if it were to happen and the law takes place there would likely be ways to detect such a fraud . i am not saying it s doubtful that someone would try there are a lot of desperate people out there like committing crimes just to get healthcare and or get out of the weather . that s not necessarily a failure on their part though it s a failure on societies part as a whole for putting them in that type of position .
lxlqlxl	cfjthkp	1392865422	. it depends on how much of the good/service is derived from the cost of wages . if the wages for a product is say 25 percent of the product meaning something that costs 1 dollar the cost of producing said product would be 25 cents . so let s say that 25 percent is derived from minimum wage labor at 7.25 and at 10.15 is a 40 increase so the cost of wages would go from 0.25 to 0.35 . so the dollar cost before would now be 1.10 and that assumes that all costs are at the bare minimum and ca n't be lowered further without going out of business .
lxlqlxl	cewg3qa	1390440481	. to be fair this is not the worse thing he has said or done when you count all the shit on dragons den and shark tank . the real problem is not the bullshit he spews but simply the fact that he and a lot of people in his wealth range and above have a disconnect with reality . they see only what they have before them and nothing more . they may think they are good people and all that and that they are not like how they really are but it does n't make it true . what people like him do is once they get to the top they do things to protect their position which essentially pulls the ladder up behind them . making it even harder for the next person to come along . making it so if they were a year or so later in life that they themselves might not have made it . wealth is not derived from handwork and good decisions . it is derived from luck plain and simple . whatever hand you were dealt and the opportunities that spawned from that luck . think of it like this for the average person there are opportunities here and there that could lead to that kind of wealth if the right decisions are made and everything falls into place . for those beneath them the opportunities are farther and farther in between . for the rich and those like kevin the opportunities are all over the place and it s just a matter of picking one and going with it . certain opportunities leading to better returns but still . with each person at the top like that pulling the ladders up behind them they are essentially putting more and more distance between the opportunities of those beneath them . what kevin and a lot of people who share his views do not understand is that this is unsustainable . the massive divide can not be sustained . sooner or later there will be a correction .
lxlqlxl	cji4rlp	1407290933	. if the incident is never recorded then it almost always ends up in the favor of the police well even with video it does but it creates public awareness so hopefully one day we can stop the abuses . but what most people who are against recording police think if it s not recorded it does n't happen .
lxlqlxl	cfjsy1h	1392864242	. the minimum i agree with but if you do have 2 jobs only having 1 company pay the minimum would bring too much confusion and it could incentivize decreasing hours especially if hours or time worked for one company determined which company had to pay the minimum . not to mention the trailing company could get away with stealing from the other company via hiring other companies employees that they know already have a first/second job . all in all it s too big of a gap for employers to exploit so it would have to apply to all jobs or no jobs .
lxlqlxl	cj61eua	1406164107	. i am in a similar position most of the jobs i can find though are too far away and in some situations it would put me in or close to negative cash flow . i would settle for a job right now that was crap but that paid above the minimum wage within a 40 mile radius .
lxlqlxl	ch8k3rr	1399131471	. so where does it stop then . if you cut a rich persons taxes the burden is placed on middle and lower classes if you cut theirs it s placed on the rich . and that s only to keep current spending levels if you argue the tax cuts as a form of de-funding the government then we get into the area of what should we pay for then . just military . just some entitlements . just some roads . which should get priority . now if you actually want to get to the paying off the debt then how are you going to do that by cutting what you bring in . if you keep taxes where they are and then cut spending to those things you do n't like then you could take that money left over and actually pay down the debt but that s not what you really want is it . debt s only matter when the other guy is in office . or are you for the current level of debt and do n't want it to decrease and increase if so then in order to give businesses 310 billion dollars in tax cuts you have to marry that with 310 billion in cuts to the budget to balance it i assume you are for a balanced budget . so which programs do you want to cut and by how much to make up that 310 billion over 10 years . or do you subscribe to the magical voodoo thinking that the tax cuts will some how increase tax revenue .
lxlqlxl	cf744o1	1391551986	. gt look clearly i ca n't consume the same number of apples as 1,000 people . i can consume something else that is more expensive that is of the same value as 1,000 apples . but will the cost of that new thing you consumed that is now valued at what 1000 apples would be valued at would it still have the same effect on jobs . the amount of jobs needed to produce and bring those 1000 apples to market would they be equal to or less than the cost of that single super apple . gt also i do n't think most rich people consume their massive wealth otherwise they would stop being wealthy they are usually concerned with preserving or growing it . ding ding ding we have a winner . those on the lower end of the scale spend most of their money not because they do n't want to save it but simply for the fact that they need to do so in order to survive . giving money to the rich has less of an impact on our economy than does giving to the poor . gt then they can easily spend all of their money and it is helping to grow the economy . they will not spend all of their money that s part of the problem with a growing economy . a growing economy needs the money to cycle through the system . i am not saying that saving is bad but simply that the premise you laid out is fallacious . not to mention that even if they did spend all of their money it still would likely not be as beneficial for the economy than it would if the same amount of money was given to and spent by lower end consumers . gt poor people usually do n't do much investing . again when you are scraping by trying to put food on the table it s kind of hard to call up your broker to buy more stock and or invest a few hundred bucks into a growing business and hope to actually get a benefit from it . gt i do n't see any reason why supply side should be considered a lie . think of it like this . let s say you are starting out and you are selling widgets . you have done a test run and you expect the demand for your widgets to be 5k a month with a minor increase over the next 6 months . would you then go to your supplier and pay for and request 1 million widgets . and expect to sell them all within a 6 month time frame . no you would analyze how much inventory you can hold at any one point in time and try not to exceed it unless you expect a huge volume of orders coming in . so let s say you want to keep 2 months supply on hand you would likely purchase around 17k widgets max . why . to keep up with demand . the position of supply side economics actually working is purchasing those 1 million widgets and expecting them to sell out within a reasonable time frame . the only area that supply side works is in areas where there is general reasonable growth and other things can come in and fill that gap . for instance take the internet and broadband . before broadband there was not a huge demand for video since the capacity increased better services can be offered and delivered that require greater bandwidth . think of it like increasing the capacity for growth supplying that capacity and other things coming in and filling it out . gt since good entrepreneurs can predict what people would be willing to give thing up for they can take steps to make more of that stuff . thus value is created . only insofar as there is a demand for it . if there is no demand for the price point they sell at and or will be profitable for them then it will fail . value is only created if that stuff is profitable and the profitability relies on demand not the supply of new said stuff . the demand for higher priced items are higher due to the economy being good for the well off . for the goods and services for the lower classes the demand is low due to the economy being bad for them . less pay greater hours worked etc . if they were paid a bit more that would increase demand and with increased demand it also usually results in increased jobs which then feeds back into more demand . gt i know people value grapes more than dirt sunshine and grape seeds . when i turn my grape seeds dirt and sunshine into grapes i have created value . why is this a lie . supply can outpace demand easily . any good entrepreneur knows this . in the grape instance if the market is saturated with grapes then guess what happens . if the grapes are over priced guess what happens . how can a grape be overpriced . if the amount of money a consumer has values that grape less than what the price for it is . with stagnate wages that price for that grape has to stay low in order for true demand to be equal to its worth . if there are cheaper grapes on the market that demand for yours will shrink and it could easily shrink so far that you are no longer able to remain profitable . this decreases choice in the market and at the very low end of the spectrum people are forced to buy cheaper and cheaper products because all of their other fixed costs are increasing while their wages do not . supply meets demand you ca n't just say here is supply now here comes the demand . if you build it they will come sure insofar as there is a demand for it .
lxlqlxl	cfhev87	1392639053	. while i generally agree this i believe does have a lot of value . just because you are older does not mean you have some special way of understanding the world or gain new insight knowledge or superior intellect . it simply means you have had time to potentially grow and or have more experiences . as such and with the ever growing decrease in time needed to read books is put on the back bumper so to speak . with that said some of these things are complex to try to explain to someone railing about free-trade and globalism being good . thinking that since we are selling more american goods than before is good and they leave it at that but do not dare extend their logical thought to the resulting trade deficit which really tells the story . i personally think that they should have went into a bit more detail and explained a few things a bit better but it s a good start and hopefully it can shed some light on a few things for those people who seem to be fine with free trade agreements . i personally do n't think learning should be fun but it does need to be somewhat interesting or done in a way that can keep interest and this is a way to do it . a picture says a thousand words not really but it can help illustrate a point along with a few words and can potentially drive the point further than it would had it been strewn in a few pieces within the text of an entire book and to grasp certain nuances you had to have a decent understanding of it to begin with . also who s to say that before reading that they had no interest and it actually lead them to read more books on the subject in order to try to refute the claims so they could square the previous logic so to speak . a lot of people are very firmly held in their beliefs and practice cognitive dissonance to an insane level but quite a few that get thrown in with that crowd would actually listen to reason and or start to see it as it really is rather than some corporation and or special interest pushing for it . this could have been a lot better but i believe it does have a place here and it can help overall . would it be better to gain a lot more knowledge on the issue and then come to realize these things . sure but that s fantasy . that s shutting people out of the conversation that could have serious potential to help fix certain problems . now as for the bumper sticker deal . it s a few fold greater in depth but i will take it as simply exaggerating to prove a point .
lxlqlxl	cj61ki2	1406164440	. we need to sit down and say what is it that we are really trying to do . if we are trying to house people and provide food for basic necessities then you can have a system setup where the renters are not paying the landlord directly . you can keep ebt for food if you qualify . then whatever is left over allow them to use that money to try to improve their life find a job transportation etc . so any money they squander would not risk them losing a roof over their head . provide financial consulting free job training educational opportunities etc .
lxlqlxl	ch2eb77	1398491436	. you said 200bil to give us all broadband while somewhat accurate to be more accurate the 200 billion was to roll out fiber to the door to most of the u.s . even at that time when fiber was expensive 1000 dollars per household could have went a long way . the requirements for that money was simply that they roll out x amount of fiber which they did and only did that there was no requirements that they actually had to use that fiber in their networks that s why we have a shit ton of dark fiber today and to top it off municipalities and other companies wanting to take advantage of that fiber and or use it in some way are being blocked by the people who got the subsidy for doing it . the goal was to i think get around 40/40mbit service . our development would have been far greater had they actually did that . the 200 billion was a mixture of handing them money and tax breaks and primarily went to pad their wallets . isp s are already insanely profitable and that just helped them become even more .
lxlqlxl	ch00oij	1398271993	. you do realize that you can draw from the grid and still provide a net of more power than you take out of the grid right . i mean it s not a hard concept to grasp . during daylight hours when solar is at its peak you can potentially generate far more than you use during the entire day at night when no power is being generated via solar you draw from the grid but the net usage for that day is less than what was generated . in order to do what you are suggesting you would need a place to store the excess power like through a bank of batteries . this also does n't cover the problem during extended cloud cover and other instances where solar will not produce enough so the grid will take up the slack .
lxlqlxl	cfz821e	1394482101	. if you are talking about when mccain said to that crazy ass woman that obama was n't an arab mccain responded with no ma'am he s a decent family man citizen that i just happen to have disagreements with . that implies that arabs are not or can not be decent family men and or citizens . is that racist . maybe not explicitly but it s not completely non-racist either as it labels all arabs as a group in a negative light .
lxlqlxl	cehwun8	1388939975	. never said you had to read anything i write . but you not doing so purely because they are long indicates laziness and or lacking in attention span . maybe this is the reason you lean right who knows . now as for the last bit . my post although it may not be 100 correct it does have some basis in logical reasoning and a clear view of the issue . you on the other hand appear to throw logic to the wind and or choose to side with those who do n't have your best interests in mind . likely out of a misguided perception that you will one day become one of them . that is of course unless you are already rich then if so congrats which could explain your bias . i mean why leave that ladder down for other people to climb up and get a piece of your pie right .
lxlqlxl	cgbesg1	1395752332	. it s all bullshit they will hike up prices regardless . the only logical explanation i can think of to lower prices if it fails is that they are going to extort content providers so content receivers can be subsidized a bit and either not have their rates increased as much and or decreased . which could potentially lower what you pay your isp but increase what you have to pay to a content provider over the same connection .
lxlqlxl	cgbu6hr	1395785285	. gt it should add an isp fee to your netflix bill . i am not 100 sure but it seems logical that any agreement they make would include an nda and or something to not say hey this is why the bill went up you know in exchange for a smaller extortion fee . think of it like someone breaking into your home holding you hostage and basically saying if any of you speak to the police i will kill any family member near me when i find out and people on the outside will kill the rest or some shit . gt it makes no sense for an isp to claim netflix should pay them to carry data requested/generated by the isps own customer . it makes perfect sense in a business point of view . while a divx disc that you pay for but only get to watch a few times without paying more and any watches after that you have to have your dvd/divx box connected to a phone line so you can pay per additional view makes absolute no sense to most if not all consumers from a business perspective it makes perfect sense . while the downloader is the one making the choice and they already pay a very large fee for the service offered if not for the content provider they would not be able to make that choice . think of it like taxes . a consumer pays a tax on the product the retailer pays a tax the distributor pays a tax etc . every instance you can stick your finger into the proverbial honey so to speak you do . now with that said does it make any sense to a consumer . no not at all because it s an attempt to completely change the dynamic in a way that an already incredibly profitable industry can be even more insanely profitable . if they were hurting for money and the money was going to upgrading the networks to boost capacity and or speed then i think a lot of people might not be for it . however when it s going to line some big wigs pockets oh hell no . gt the fact that netflix does n't charge the isp for peering means isps are getting a huge break . now that does n't make any sense . lightly looking at it from an obscure angle maybe but in reality it does n't . think of it like kellogg charging a supermarket to carry their product . kellogg gets money from the supermarket selling their product and if they up and charged them a fee for that privilege then maybe they do n't carry your product and if they do most of that could easily be passed onto the consumer . it will turn into how something like cable tv is run . the only reason why that model works at all is due to how it s setup . the cable provider pays for content but is allowed to run commercials or charge the consumer an additional fee for access like for hbo which does n't have traditional commercials where the cable provider can profit from . if they did do that type of thing for instance instead of a content provider having a popup here and there and or having an ad on the side . the isp would have to cut all connections to that provider and make you sit through a commercial in order to gain access back to the content . that sounds a bit overly intrusive to me gt the consumers of content should be paying for the content . an isp does n't consume . it simply allows the infrastructure for an entity to consume . if you are talking about actual consumers rather than the people providing the pipes so to speak then i mostly agree but that s what they are doing now and have been doing . even a free service is n't really free . you provide them with all types of information that they can then sell and or find a way to profit from . or simply throwing up advertisements . the former though should be more transparent so you know who all is receiving your information beyond the first entity you give it to .
lxlqlxl	cg5uyem	1395172060	. while i am generally against bailouts like the bank situation i can see why it was necessary . however the way it went should n't have gone that way . there should have been a lot more regulation put into place to stop the too big to fail shit but those who typically rail against bailouts where against such regulation . it s like being for more horsepower in a car but being against brakes and or seatbelts . i agree if something fails it should fail but when the economy hangs in the balance it ca n't be that way so the solution is to break the banks up and or make it so that any one single failure and or multiple failures ca n't bring the entire system down . this is done through common sense regulation . and again those who are so against bailouts are also against that common sense regulation .
lxlqlxl	cf732vt	1391549843	. thank you i just find it very idiotic for someone to suggest they have any business sense at all to make the argument of if the wage doubles the price of the product would double as well . it assumes that the cost of the product is 100 the cost of labor and i am not sure in many if any industries that is the case . just throwing out some arbitrary figures here let s say the cost of a burger right now is 1 dollar granted the dollar menu went up for the mcdouble but again these are purely arbitrary . let s say 1 dollar is the cost to the consumer less tax . now let s say the cost of labor to produce that burger is 25 cents . the cost for the foodstuff to create it let s say it s at 15 cents . the cost for the building and other machinery needed to bring said foodstuff to the consumer is 35 cents . franchise fee let s say 10 cents . that would leave 15 cents for the owner holder of the franchising license . with each of these figures you have some wiggle room . some more than others . so if let s say the cost of employment doubles to 50 cents you could at the worse case scenario raise it to 1.25 or you could potentially dig into other areas and reduce those costs . the owner could take 8 cents instead of 15 . the owner could negotiate higher purchase orders due to increased demand for the foodstuff down to let s say 28 cents . that would then result in the burger price increase being a total of 1.14 . again purely arbitrary figures i am not suggesting any of them are 100 correct just trying to show some of the process . the actual process is a lot more complicated with some nuances like waste you could train the employees better to reduce the total waste which would help as well . you can use your 1/3 figure as well if you want . now as for some wages not being doubled and or having an effect on them . the current federal minimum wage is 7.25 . the push right now is to increase it to 10.10 . any jobs that are paid between 7.25 and 10.10 will be at the very least now at 10.10 . since most jobs that pay above minimum wage do so to remain attractive to some degree they will go up as a result . think of a cylinder of sorts and you have plates at each level one at 7.25 one at 7.75 8.10 9.10 10.10 11.10 12.10 13.10 etc . the plates between 7.25 and let s say 13.10 will not be necessarily separated by air . meaning as soon as the 7.25 plate rises it will keep bumping into each plate moving them up keeping each at the same rate of pay . instead there will be different sized compressible materials between let s say something like cotton . the higher you push the bottom plate the more compressed the material gets but never really completely equal . so that 10.10 an hour job right now if the minimum wage increases to 10.10 an hour that job will likely increase to 11/12 an hour . that 13.10 an hour job likely will increase to 14 or so the higher up the cylinder you get the less of an impact on the wages .
lxlqlxl	cjv466j	1408496243	. so he was high now . where was that in the evidence . also where was the old lady in this . but back to the point the only drug i could think of where you would be stupid/ignorant enough to run away saying i am going to kill you then run back is something like bath salts and if he were on that shit the video if it was him would be very very different .
lxlqlxl	cf87lpd	1391654829	. wealth redistribution does indeed change the total demand . you appear to equating money solely as the only criteria for demand . a rich person buying a pair of shoes for let s say 10,000 dollars does not have the same effect on the economy than 200 people buying shoes at 50 bucks a pop . more salesman and more workers are needed just to keep this short . that salesman selling a pair of shoes for 10k likely is not necessarily poor themselves so some of their pay would likely go to savings and or buying higher end items . a the lower end you have people who do n't save much due to not being able to and that money goes right back into the economy . one is more stimulative to the economy than the other . hopefully you should be able to understand that . now as for gt i think any arbitrary and non voluntary method of wealth redistribution is bad all wealth redistribution would fit that bill to someone if they knew all/most of the facts . society and our social construct is built around wealth redistribution . that money you have in your pocket right now unless it was taken straight from the printing press/bank has been in someone else s . it was redistributed to you . gt economic freedom is in the best interests of all honest men . unfortunately we are not ruled by honest men . there are no true honest men/women . some may come pretty close but unless they are extraordinary they are n't . i personally try to be as honest as i can but to be 100 honest 100 of the time is not within my capability . for instance let s say my significant other asks does this make my ass look fat if i think so i will say yes . unless of course they are not feeling that well or are having a bad day or something to that effect . if so i may say no or try to sidestep it . when they are then feeling better and things are conducive to being able to speak the truth with the least amount of harm i will apologize and then tell them the truth . also when you use economic freedom i assume you mean in the hands of the rich and or corporations mainly . with all that you have said it seems that it is not conducive to reality which would point to a higher minimum wage actually giving more economic freedom .
lxlqlxl	cfcd6h9	1392097916	. while i am for raising the minimum wage i would say that in some cases albeit very limited cases that it would be possible so long as you do n't have kids or have anyone depending on you . for instance if you were able to find very cheap rent for around 300/350 a month ate the bare minimum lived close to where you work and walk to work did n't pay for healthcare qualified for medicaid and your state expanded it etc . then it is possible but only just . you would have very little left over to do anything really . there would be little to no leisure activities possible . you would essentially be living to work and getting very little out of it other than sustaining life within the bare minimum acceptable levels that is acceptable by society . so yeah i agree with the last part the quality of life would be in the shitter .
lxlqlxl	cjz606d	1408895592	. i was n't going to comment on this but reading this part yeah gt outside of a crowd-control context there are many reasons why police need what some would define as <SPECIAL> equipment . ummm because it was military equipment . that s why most rational minded people would define it as military equipment . i do n't get how that s a foreign concept that person . then suggesting taking away firetrucks due to being used in medical calls . wtf kind of reasoning is that . also the whole militarized nature of police these days is not all about the equipment it s about the attitude us vs them and everyone is a danger to them getting a hangnail so we must taze and or shoot to kill for fear of said possible hangnail .

lxlqlxl	ch01dbf	1398273409	. my post should have been more toward both with the emphasis toward fantasyfest but i can see the validity in pointing out the absolutist language . assuming solar users only access the grid during times of putting power back into the grid does not align with how solar works and the many different caveats like only say producing enough energy via solar for gt 100 of usage for instance which would reduce the amount owed and not eliminate it .

lxlqlxl	cks12ox	1411636156	. the general public as well as officers see black people like that person as more of a threat than say a white person in the same type of clothing in the same type of scenario . so they are treated with more hostility . just to be clear i am white . however growing up and still living around racists and seeing encounters with police it s fairly easy to tell black people are treated more harshly . then you have institutional racism . go to just about any courtroom in a southern state and sit back and watch and tally up who gets what when . a black and a white person both with similar backgrounds and records both with similar criminal histories both up for an identical charge the black person will almost certainly always get the harsher sentence . the last few times i was in a courtroom . the white people always got 30 days suspended sentence for less than 1 ounce of marijuana but the black people for the most part got the 30 to 45 days . but hey if you want to believe we are in a post racial era go for it be blind to the truth .
lxlqlxl	ci3jhmq	1402367451	. because it s in the bible your silly . but seriously though i do n't understand how seemingly rational and unless you talk to them about shit like this somewhat intelligent people can somehow believe in the literal interpretation of the bible and or certain things in it . i am not of any faith but from what i know i could say there was probably a jesus son of god . doubtful but an actual person named jesus who helped start christianity sure but noah adam/eve those are the ones who anyone in their right mind would be like ok that s bullshit but hey nice story right . i mean for fucks sake noah was supposed to be 600 years old or so when the flood happened . wtf . since noah obviously came after adam/eve how old were they or was noah special or some shit . that s not even bringing up the whole 1 arc 2 animals of every kind except for the dinosaurs of course apparently noah was bigoted against dinosaurs . all in all if anyone ever says they believe in the literal interpretation of the bible hell new or old their intelligence level is automatically downgraded significantly .
lxlqlxl	ch8j529	1399128612	. it seems as though you assume that 310 billion will go toward creating jobs it wo n't or at least not one where someone previously in foster care ages out . this bill would have been to provide those people with documents that are needed for work or did you even read it . with out a social security card birth certificate how are they even going to apply for a job that is n't under the table . sure a company raking in 250 mil a year in profits will hire these at risk people yeah that makes tons of sense . just to be clear you are for an assistance program to large businesses to pad their profits and wallets to the tune of 310 billion but against some very minor assistance to those who age out of foster care to the tune of 12 million over the same time period . for corporate welfare but against social welfare .
lxlqlxl	cj62pp3	1406166906	. the fundamental flaw to the automation argument is that robots will never replace everyone in the workforce and if they did it would be like store owners and or factory owners shooting themselves in the foot . the only scenario that would likely play out is if they solely exported the goods and and had little to no desire to sell within the u.s or only sold to those who had jobs they could n't automate . automation is not perfect and never will be there will always be some type of work that needs to be done and the labor force will shift . you also have to understand the ratio of how much automation would cost vs employee pay to do x amount of work . to replace a mcdonalds worker right now with a machine and not drastically change their stores around to suit it would be in the millions if not higher per store so technically everything else being equal you could pay them 30 bucks an hour and still not make automation look attractive . the only jobs that would be in trouble are those that workers are paid right at what it would cost automation and once forced to pay workers over that threshold then they would move toward automation . machines do n't have to be paid but they have to be paid for . they have to be maintained there are sunk costs to maintaining automation . with automation you have to plan ahead and try to see where trends are going . an automation system that you could buy today or project with say a 5-10 year life cycle could be obsolete in 3 . that s not even considering specific regulations that would have to be considered to keep the public safe .
lxlqlxl	cffw6zq	1392460401	. to be somewhat fair they did do something with it the 200 billion in 1996 that was supposed to bring 100/100 to the door for the majority of americans that was 1000 dollars for every household . they rolled out enough fiber to comply but instead of making it live they kept it dark . google dark fiber . from my understanding there is easily 1000 s of miles of dark fiber available right now . most cable companies from my understanding used the money to roll out a fiber backbone of sorts and left the last mile so to speak as coaxial . i believe in an effort to keep costs a little higher to make it seem as their insane profits are not as insane as they would be had they rolled out fiber to the door . with that said the primary thing i have against the other persons post is the notion that cable companies are not monopolies of course they are . dsl if it were an option for me right now i might would think about it . i do n't live within a mile or so from a hub so i do n't have that option . satellite is a joke even with the major improvements that have been made .
lxlqlxl	cj62zxb	1406167517	. lump sums i agree are not the way to go that s why i severely disagree that eic actually helps poverty it sort of does but only rounding the edges off of those who are close to getting out of poverty to begin with those that are deep within it it does little to nothing other than give a temporary boost . with that said i would be for a small monthly disbursement of actual cash or like a check you could cash but depending on what we as a society deems to want these people to do with the money then it could be done a few different ways . like if housing is a major concern it would be fairly easy to setup a system to pay housing directly and just allow the recipient to choose which housing they want within a range of course . we could keep foodstamps for those that qualify and have that deducted out of the cash amount setup a certain percentage for an ebt like system where you could use it to buy food hot or cold clothing and other things deemed to help them improve their life and nothing like alcohol and the rest given by a check that way they could not as other people have suggested here squander it . their basic necessities would be met and the money they have left over could help improve their position in life if they so choose .
lxlqlxl	chyllho	1401848981	. gt you re correct i am not sure how . by that logic anyone should be able to legally sell drugs . if you make selling drugs illegal then it s not against the constitution if you make lobbying illegal and or impose stricter limits it should n't be an issue . again if your logic held up would n't the limits imposed now be unconstitutional and if so why has no one took it to court won and overturned it .
lxlqlxl	cidxbdw	1403425844	. there are very few if any who have done it on their own . if you look at it in a larger social context no one gets rich on their own they all were afforded the ability to get rich by the confines of the society they were in . be it using the roads that were publicly funded law enforcement firemen etc etc . just to give you an idea on how some of those self-made people think and the lunacy of it all .
lxlqlxl	ch2fsqf	1398497869	. when the taxes are more flat and or less progressive it means that those who are less rich have to put more into the system to keep the same level of funding if you have less funding less things get funded and that leads to crumbling infrastructure . with that said demand drives supply supply can not ever really drive demand . say you have 100k widgets to sell but real demand is only around 5k at a price point that is break even and or a small profit having that extra 95k is n't going to magically increase demand . what does increase demand is more people who spend money having more money . that can be done a little bit by lowering certain taxes but that s only a pittance overall if they were instead paid more to start with that would increase demand . the lower in the income brackets that you go the more money they spend mostly out of necessity and the less they save . if you gave 5k to someone in the upper middle class to rich category they would likely throw it into their bank . if you gave it or split it up a bit and went to a poor neighborhood and gave it to them it would be gone in a matter of days either paying bills buying some clothes to try to improve their job prospects or buying food or other necessities . oh and the inequality is r gt g not r lt d i can see your point about calling it an equation but that s not the worse part of the article it was poorly written to begin with decent message and meaning overall but poorly executed . gt piketty argues that the 200-plus years of income and wealth data complied by him and a team of researchers demonstrates that returns on capital r significantly outstrip growth in the real economy g which relentlessly drives up inequality . his basic equation r gt g has upended the way economists understand wealth and income distribution . so you were saying . seems a bit like selective reading but hey .

spudmonkey	cie1tt8	1403448464	. my original comment simply pointed out that the linked rule was published in a revision of the document that released after the events in question . that seems like a reasonable thing to note to me . i have never denied that a similar rule was in place in 2011 or asserted that some other rule was in place in 2011 . indeed i stated that it was likely that a similar rule was in place but the linked document was useless as proof of that fact . op linked an irrelevant document . i pointed this fact out think that perhaps op would like to fix his post . i have no onus to prove or provide anything . i was simply noting that the op had a logical error in his post . period end of story . you hopped in and posted a link from 2003 version so i replied that the linked version said it replaced the 2010 version and thus your version was no more useful as a supporting document than ops link . as a rhetorical tactic i pointed out that without the actual document in effect at the time of the events posting versions that existed before and had been replaced or after noting that it had been revised was essentially useless since neither provide any documentation of the actual rule as existed in 2011 . for all any of us know the rule in effect at that time could involve printing them out folding them into origami swans and mailing them off to belize . absurd . yes but we have no proof otherwise . the fact of the matter is that without the 2010 document we ca n't say anything about what the rules were in 2011 . of course it is reasonable to assume that the rules were similar . i said that in my first f**king post . but you ca n't claim to know that as a fact without having the document operative at the time . then we got here . i honestly ca n't tell if you are just being a pain in my ass or if you really want to argue the point . a historical example might server to illustrate what i mean . op posts a link to a newspaper article from 1935 noting that the tax on beer is going to be raised as support for an assertion that alcohol sales were legal in the us in 1930 . i point out that his newspaper article does n't actually say anything about the law in 1930 . you hop in with a similar article talking about how wine import taxes are going to be lowered from sometime in 1918 . then you tell me that clearly we can assume that alcohol sales have always been legal in the us . well that is factually incorrect . i this case both you and op have provided evidence that proves nothing about the law in effect at the time under consideration . rules and laws can and do change . the can and do change particularly in large organizations seemingly randomly and capriciously .
spudmonkey	cidgp6z	1403376487	. gt just so you are aware the manual you link was published on march 27 2014 and thus was not applicable at the time of the event . gt i do n't doubt that the regulation existing at the time of the crash were similar but the one you link was not it . see how i was agreeing with you and just trying to keep you from looking like an idiot for citing something from 2014 to cover a situation that occurred years before . yeah i did n't think so . i will just say it one more time . i do n't disagree with your implication but the document you cite is not applicable because it was not in effect in 2011 . you do n't have to update your citation frankly i am well past caring if you look like a moron but you are citing a document that is inapplicable . what part of this do you have trouble understanding . it you cite a document that states that it was revised in 2014 you ca n't claim it is the one in effect in 2011 . go find a copy of rules in effect at that time and then your citation will be worth something .

spudmonkey	cjvgxxm	1408537660	. gt on the one hand the da who got a dui and berated police should have never be allowed to return to her post . on the other hand with-holding funds based on that alone is n't ethical at all . the problem is that the da is an elected official and there are no laws in place at the state level to remove a da should stuff like this happen . a district judge makes the decision not the governor . perry has absolutely no legal authority to remove her from office so he tried to do via threats and veto . he could have proposed a law to prevent this issue in the future in the most recent legislative session but neither he nor his party did . the public integrity unit of the travis co das office has long been a target for the republicans in texas . so to those of us who pay attention to texas politics this looks a whole lot like a governor over reaching for political purposes . edit added portion about district judge .
spudmonkey	cjs3k65	1408216681	. well that is just the issue . there is no legal grounds for removing her because of her dui and post arrest behavior . having a single dui is not a disqualification for serving as a da in texas . perry could have asked the legislature to impeach her i think he could have called for laws to make it so that a da convicted of a crime would be removed from office . but he did n't do either of those things . he threatened to use his veto power to defund her office if she did not resign . then he carried through on the threat when she did not . mind you her office contains the state political corruption unit it is n't just for travis co and that office just happened to be investigation some questionable state funds given to perry campaign donors at the time of his threat . see how this come to be a problem for him . he could have taken the actual moral high road and called for a new law to control misbehavior by prosecutors in the state but he did n't . instead he tried to force her out which is a power he does not legally have . it is a little like him threatening to mayor of houston with cutting some funds if she does n't resign and then doing it . he is not in charge of who is mayor of houston or da in any of the counties .
spudmonkey	cjruzr1	1408193235	. surely resignation impacts official duty . it leaves the elected office vacant and in this case would have allowed perry to appoint someone to fill the post until the next election or special election not sure which applies . by trying to force her resignation he essentially tried to force her to abandon all of her official duties . it ends up being a bit like nixon s saturday night massacre given that she had criminal oversight of his actions .

spudmonkey	cjs3k65	1408216681	. well that is just the issue . there is no legal grounds for removing her because of her dui and post arrest behavior . having a single dui is not a disqualification for serving as a da in texas . perry could have asked the legislature to impeach her i think he could have called for laws to make it so that a da convicted of a crime would be removed from office . but he did n't do either of those things . he threatened to use his veto power to defund her office if she did not resign . then he carried through on the threat when she did not . mind you her office contains the state political corruption unit it is n't just for travis co and that office just happened to be investigation some questionable state funds given to perry campaign donors at the time of his threat . see how this come to be a problem for him . he could have taken the actual moral high road and called for a new law to control misbehavior by prosecutors in the state but he did n't . instead he tried to force her out which is a power he does not legally have . it is a little like him threatening to mayor of houston with cutting some funds if she does n't resign and then doing it . he is not in charge of who is mayor of houston or da in any of the counties .
spudmonkey	cjrx1n5	1408200361	. lol glad to help . i would not want to do your job sounds even more complicated than texas . fyi this wo n't impact his term as governor he is not running for reelection so he is out in early 2015 no matter what happens with the indictment . however it could be a real problem for him if he wants to run for president again in 2016 . potentially lots of bad press even if he does end up escaping conviction .
spudmonkey	cjrziox	1408206903	. she is not a part of the government he leads . she is an independently elected official and is not answerable to him in any way . also a first dui offense is either a class a or b misdemeanor . edit added quotes edit 2 added misdemeanor bit .
spudmonkey	cjviyp3	1408543229	. there is definitely a drinking culture in texas i know i am a former participant . in government circles drinking was a way of life until . i dunno maybe the early 1980s having said that the da is clearly a belligerent and obnoxious drunk who definitely deserved arrest and punishment . however that does n't give perry the right to do what he did . nor does it undo any of his questionable use of funds that he was allowed to allocate .

spudmonkey	cjxg8y6	1408716455	. no it would not be relevant to the case against perry and even if she were causing damage to her office perry is not the appropriate official to make that judgement and remedy the problem . the governor of texas is not responsible for disciplinary actions against elected county das . full stop . she was not appointed by him approved by him and is in no way answerable to him . the chain of command for a da stops with the voters . there are procedures in place to deal with a drunk da . those procedures were followed . they take place in front of the district judge . also it is important for you to know that ms lehmberg is not a participant in any way in this indictment . you implied she was in your initial post . the public integrity unit was established by the legislature to keep an eye on governmental corruption among other things . so when you refer to the travis co da you should be away that in this case she actually has state wide jurisdiction . it is important to note that had he succeeded in forcing her out he would have been able to appoint an interim da to an office that was actively investigating his use of cancer research funds.so the whole perry was protecting the public interest argument just rings false . perry s problem is that he combined an effort to get her to step down with the veto of funding . either on its own would have been fine together the add up to an effort to coerce . we will see what the jury says but honestly it is not perry s job to decide who is or is n't the county da .
spudmonkey	ckbxaqw	1410126236	. you are correct 400 ppm is a whole lot less than 1 . good for you math is n't that hard . you imply that 1 is no big deal . you are simply wrong . start eating a 1 arsenic compound and see what happens to you . and you are also correct that there are natural sources of co2 . and natural sinks for co2 too . yet year over year that concentration keeps going up . we look at ice cores and see that for the last 800,000 years the concentration has varied between 150 and 300 ppm . yet now we are at 400 ppm . what precisely do you think has made the difference .
spudmonkey	ckbh7js	1410084304	. you should read things before you use them as evidience . from the executive summary of paper 2 on the page you linked gt observations of ocean heat content and of sea-level rise suggest that the additional heat from the continued rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations has been absorbed in the ocean and has not been manifest as a rise in surface temperature . changes in the exchange of heat between the upper and deep ocean appear to have caused at least part of the pause in surface warming and observations suggest that the pacific ocean may play a key role . that does not mean the planet isn t accumulating heat . it means it has been absorbed into the oceans in a previously unexpected way .
spudmonkey	ckplqz4	1411416245	. gt there s also the distinct possibility that perry is insinuating that joan at age 81 was secretly getting an abortion oh wow thanks for implanting that though in my head . now the little guy that builds my nightmares is going to have a field day with joan rivers gets knocked up .
spudmonkey	cjvi06l	1408540818	. imho there is no chance whatsoever that he gets the nomination and not because of this indictment . he pissed off the libertarians and the religious right for wholly different reasons with his hpv vaccine move . the money people know he has a huge cloud of potential scandal hovering over him due to his use of discretionary funds . the only constituency he has in anti-immigration people and they do n't really have that much pull . he is widely regarded as an intellectual lightweight . everyone has access to the ooops video and his bizarre maple syrup video . his jobs claims are questionable . he is a mediocre middle of the road republican candidate with no particular attraction to any of the groups that show up in republican primaries .
spudmonkey	cjs3aoz	1408216034	. gt and it s all perfectly legal to get a 1st offense dui and serve in texas government . and actually not at all uncommon . we have had serving representatives get busted for solicitation and stay in office . it has been a few years decades since 9th grade texas government but i am pretty sure the legislature could have impeached her too . of course they did n't nor did perry call for it .

spudmonkey	cjvhhkl	1408539367	. you are correct there is no requirement for him to state a reason . had he just vetoed the funding all would be well . however he did make statement about the veto . to wit he stated that he would veto it unless the da resgned and incidentally he got to appoint a new da to an office actively investigating him . the changes it from a legal use of his constitutional authority into a case of do this or i will do that which is by definition coercion .
spudmonkey	cjrwgiy	1408198550	. i am no supporter of perry so asking if he was particularly stupid or reviled is like waving a red flag in front of a bull but i will be good . this is a state level case so there is no relation to anything with the us congress . this is a little complicated so sorry if i confuse you i am trying to make if clear . the public corruption unit of which the dui da is the head is a state funded entity housed in and run by the travis co das office . it investigates state wide public corruption charges tax fraud and election stuff . the majority of the texas government is controlled by republicans . travis co is largely democratic . das in texas are elected . so the usually democratic travis county da oversees corruption charges over the mostly republican state of texas government . this has long been an irritation for the republicans in texas . the public corruption unit was investigating the use cptir cancer prevention research institute of texas funds . it was alleged that perry had directed funds to people he liked . then the travis county da got busted for drunk really drunk driving . she pled guilty did some time in jail and went to rehab . perry called for her resignation . she did n't resign . perry threatened to cut state funding to the public corruption unit . lt this sets up the problem . she did n't resign . perry cut the funding . lt this is the problem by threatening to cut funding if the da did n't resign and the following through on that threat he appears to have tried to coerce a public official into doing what he wished . this is a crime in texas . legally the das dui and the indictment of perry are unrelated .
spudmonkey	cjyeodd	1408811427	. gt i d just as quickly name any others of any other race and yet you did not . you chose to name two dead young black men who unlike rick perry were not indicted of any crime relating to their deaths . if you can name people of other ethnic origins why did you not do so . gt like your real name is spudmonkey . lol . why are you hiding behind an anonymous account . you did n't really think before you typed that did you . spudmonkey is my established account on reddit . i have been using for 4 years . of course it is not my real name but it is my persona on this site . your account name actually includes the word throwaway a work generally used to describe an account created for use when the user is hiding for some reason . gt just another personal attack big deal . why not discuss the actual topic . it is not an attack it a statement of my assessment of your personality . i have looked at some of your former posts . you support the idea that criminality is genetic . you imply that it is the children s fault that black children are disciplined disproportionately in kindergartens . you make misogynistic comments . you seem to enjoy talking about reverse racism and discrimination against christian white men southerners country music listeners etc . your comments are generally bombthrowing you rarely add anything useful or interesting to the discussion . and yet your username indicated that you have little invested in this particular account . thus i consider you to be a punk causing trouble while not being willing to stand behind your statements and positions . fwiw if you name actually is throwaway i would recommend you sue your parents . edit reworded second sentence to indicate that the choice of the two black men was a relevant choice for u/throwaway___013 to have made .

saijanai	clczri4	1413651188	. obamacare was a massive compromise . you re just spouting pro-3rd-party rhetoric . it s hard to tell if you re spouting it because you believe in 3rd parties or because you re trying to convince people to vote 3rd part in order to dilute the vote but either way 3rd parties benefit the gop far more these days so its the equivalent of calling for dems to stay home and not bother to vote .
saijanai	ciiemb5	1403868298	. gt i d prefer plan a because no tax raises are typically a good thing . but making the public school system efficient is never going to happen because it s the government . so that s one problem i have . maharishi mahesh yogi the hindu monk who founded teh tm organization was adamament all his career that governments should be paying for tm instruction . it never went very far as while a specific president of a country like joachim rodrigo of mozambique . before he died teh old monk jacked the price to learn tm through the roof saying that the wealthy of the world set the trends and fashions of the time and the rich do n't shop at poor stores . these days the david lynch foundation gets famous meditators like ringo starr and paul mccartney to sing duets at fund raisers . the official price for tm is still sky-high so the filthy rich can feel special when they learn but between scholarships through the tm organization and the dlf stepping in when the normal scholarships are n't enough just about anyone at any level of income can afford to learn tm . the dlf s mandate is to make sure that anyone can learn tm who wants to so it s just a matter of parents convincing the schools to request the tm teachers and the dlf finding specific funding for an entire school to learn for free . of course the old monk s rhetoric concerning saving the world attracted fanatical people i m a skeptic by comparison to some and when the world wasnt saved overnight they flipped their beliefs and became just as fanatically anti-tm as they were pro-tm . i know people whose mission in life is to make sure that no new us school will ever work with the dlf to implement tm and are proud of having a part in getting parents riled up against it on religious ground . this echoes what happened in nepal west africa when the hereditary president learned tm and decided to have all federal prisoners learn it with the result that the recidivism rate went from over 90 to less than 10 . the islamic mullahs took note and decreed that tm was anti-islam so the program was discontinued . it s amazing how fundamentalists of every religion all seem to think the same way .

saijanai	clczri4	1413651188	. obamacare was a massive compromise . you re just spouting pro-3rd-party rhetoric . it s hard to tell if you re spouting it because you believe in 3rd parties or because you re trying to convince people to vote 3rd part in order to dilute the vote but either way 3rd parties benefit the gop far more these days so its the equivalent of calling for dems to stay home and not bother to vote .
saijanai	cjl7im6	1407560534	. the above historical review suggests that the objectives mechanisms and constituencies of federal student aid today are considerably more diffuse and complex than they were a quarter century ago . thus gauging the impact and success of aid policies over this period is far from cut-and-dried and this paper will only scratch the surface of such an evaluation . in other words a cute one-liner does n't even begin to explain things .

saijanai	clm0gzw	1414490913	. citing a sound-bite from fox news . really . here s a fuller quote gt <SPECIAL> knows better than you the strain on hospitals that never turned a patient away and health care providers grappling with the challenges of the uninsured and shrinking reimbursement . you know as well as anyone that our current system is unsustainable . <SPECIAL> unsustainable to individuals and their families . <SPECIAL> unsustainable for small businesses . <SPECIAL> unsustainable for your communities . <SPECIAL> unsustainable for our state local and national budgets . gt <SPECIAL> obama said one year ago when he called the first bipartisan on march 5th of last year the first bipartisan house and senate meeting together with many outside stakeholders together at the white house to find a way for us to come together . and at that time he said <SPECIAL> care reform is entitlement <SPECIAL> we can not sustain the upward spiral of the increases in health care and what that means in medicare and what it means in medicaid . so from the standpoint of our national budget and for your budgets the current system as i said is unsustainable . gt <SPECIAL> <SPECIAL> unaffordable for families individuals and families for businesses of any size and it is a cost to our economy . imagine an economy where people could follow their aspirations where they could be entrepreneurial where they could take risks professionally because personally their families health care needs are being met . where they could be self-employed or start a business not be job-locked in a job because they have health care there and if they went out on their own it would be unaffordable to them but especially true if someone has a child with a pre-existing condition . so when we pass our bill never again will people be denied coverage because they have a pre-existing condition . gt <SPECIAL> have to do this in partnership and i wanted to bring up to date on where we see it from here . the final health care legislation that will soon be passed by congress will deliver successful reform at the local level . it will offer paid for investments that will improve health care services and coverage for millions more americans . it will make significant investments in innovation prevention wellness and offer robust support for public health infrastructure . it will dramatically expand investments into community health centers . that means a dramatic expansion in the number of patients community health centers can see and ultimately healthier communities . our bill will significantly reduce uncompensated care for hospitals . gt <SPECIAL> heard about the controversies within the bill the process about the bill one or the other . but i <SPECIAL> know if you have heard that it is legislation for the future not just about health care for america but about a healthier america where preventive care is not something that you have to pay a deductible for or out of pocket . prevention prevention prevention <SPECIAL> <SPECIAL> about diet not diabetes . <SPECIAL> going to be very very exciting . gt <SPECIAL> we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it away from the fog of the controversy . furthermore we believe that health care reform again i said at the beginning of my remarks that we sent the three pillars that the <SPECIAL> economic stabilization and job creation initiatives were education and innovation <SPECIAL> innovation begins in the classroom <SPECIAL> clean energy and climate addressing the climate issues in an innovative way to keep us number one and competitive in the world with the new technology and the third first among equals i may say is health care health insurance reform . health insurance reform is about jobs . this legislation alone will create 4 million jobs about 400,000 jobs very soon .

neurn2	cg3yp2r	1394982453	. that s one lesson . the other is that if folks were n't so concerned with being genocidal assholes in order to save peoples character then those who did n't make it to the new world would have lived . ryan s ancestors had the resources to move many did not and children for example could not on their own . so yeah you can take whatever lesson you like but the bigger lesson in your mind should be do n't starve people when you have the resources not to . especially if you claim to follow a christian religion .
neurn2	cg8ibd4	1395430757	. i agree with you but since it has already happened then we have to work from a different set of priors . since states have explicitly singled out groups of individuals for special not in a good way treatment we ca n't say what should have been . because simply it was n't . now then you think gay marriage has been a flurry of outrage just wait until the apocalyptic explosion when teh evil liberultarians try to take away marriage . .

neurn2	cj0zf5r	1405698893	. here s the issue . hobby lobby says that a subset of medical issues that only affect a segment of the population is separable from all other medical issues that affect the entire population at the whim of a corporate religion . and because of this corporate religion a corporation is exempt from the law just because they believe something to be true and offensive to that corporate religion . what makes this crazier is that the belief in question is 100 verifiably not true . that s fucking insane and should scare you .
neurn2	cg8ikab	1395431283	. well you ca n't find it in the talking points but you can by their actions . threaten to even modestly raise taxes on the wealthy they will damn sure nuke the countries credit rating if that s what it takes to keep it low . raise payroll taxes which affect poor and middle class most not a peep . everything else is just red meat for the base who are all going to be super millionaires once their home plumbing business gets going and they would totally never work for a union in a place that was saved by the evil govt .
neurn2	chuvi7s	1401460932	. i absolutely do . and it is a fair point . in five years i will be interested to see if year to year increases are less than or more than they were previously . my employer insurance rates went up too bc of obamacare but far less than they did when i had my non-employer insurance in the pre-ocare times . so it can be true that for a lot of people their rates do n't go up as much as they would have without obamacare . that s the tricky bit there is not universal criticism of obamacare that does n't also apply to a pre-obamacare time . it is likely that because of requirements like payout to take in ratio will reduce increases going forward .
neurn2	cfmszaa	1393189861	. i have n't seen any evidence that people have the exact same plan with significantly higher premiums . i say significantly higher because if you are a health insurance customer you are well aware that rates increase over time . now if you have some evidence that says a lot of people have the same plan with significantly higher premiums i would be interested in seeing it . edit misspelling .
neurn2	cikv4ud	1404141703	. bullshit they are n't medically necessary . you should go re-read the sandra fluke case in which she was n't arguing for pregnancy prevention . i know it says birth control in the name but they have many uses . also preventing pregnancy can be very medically necessary for certain women .
neurn2	chv02ev	1401470949	. you left out something crucial . because they mandate that insurance companies have to accept everyone regardless of condition they also mandated everyone must get insurance . this is the only possible way to make it work and costs have not exploded the way the doom mongers predicted . the only better solution for reducing costs would have been medicare for all but lieberman is a tool .

neurn2	cj6f6lj	1406208466	. i actually have a different view of this article and think it points to progressives winning . during the reagan years these views were basically non controversial . the rhetoric today has been cranked to 11 as they desperately try to find new reasons to support clearly losing positions that are becoming untenable in the face of progress .
neurn2	ch3tjc4	1398653068	. what bothers me most about the pro-life side is that if you truly believed it was murder why would n't you do absolutely everything to prevent an abortion from occurring . by which i mean proper sex ed and free birth control . studies have shown making it illegal does n't actually decrease abortion . so these efforts feel empty and all about controlling women not ending abortion .
neurn2	cgdwkyw	1395979632	. allowing a secular entity a for profit company to have religion is a pretty big leap towards a corporate/state theocracy . the state would in essence be saying if you are religious laws do n't apply to you . rights we give to others are inferior to your religion even if you made it up on the spot . also how is hobby lobby s stance moral . where does it say in the bible one type of birth control is okay but not others . fetuses are expressly treated as property not people in the bible .
neurn2	chhq5cr	1400076428	. really . gosh i thought things could be totally free . but here s the rub because of saint reagan i was already paying for uninsured people s health care in the er . obamacare and the associated programs try to put it on the books and get as many payers as possible which has already demonstrably proven to be a winner already and lower costs . also why should n't we pay for it . other countries can and we already spend more than it would cost to do it right . let s move forward .
neurn2	cg0i4sl	1394602606	. to some degree you are correct . there was a massive correction in the 80s spurred by the reagan revolution where liberalism as defined by americans was somewhat out of ideas and was n't selling its ideas . but the conservatives have turned it into an art form . there has never been a left wing equivalent of a glen beck or sarah palin who just grifts and grifts like there is no tomorrow all while the movement just eats it up .
neurn2	chgsx24	1399987839	. again that would be fine not really but at least consistent if they were explicitly singling out those who ca n't reproduce . but they did n't come to that argument until their biblically derived hatred of gays started crashing down on them and they scrambled for a secular reason .
neurn2	chejyzi	1399743706	. the difference will probably be whether states have explicitly gone out of their way to single out and polygamy or whether it is just banned by default marriage license is only between two consenting adults . ironically if gay marriage hadnt been singled out to get bush re-elected it would be much farther away from being legal than it is now .
neurn2	cg3s2s6	1394949023	. yeah this might be the appropriate action . i do n't like that this type of nonsense dominates political reporting but have no idea how to change it . it gets clicks edit it gets more than clicks it gets people elected . lots of people say stupid things every day but tparty crazy gets people elected .

neurn2	cg3yp2r	1394982453	. that s one lesson . the other is that if folks were n't so concerned with being genocidal assholes in order to save peoples character then those who did n't make it to the new world would have lived . ryan s ancestors had the resources to move many did not and children for example could not on their own . so yeah you can take whatever lesson you like but the bigger lesson in your mind should be do n't starve people when you have the resources not to . especially if you claim to follow a christian religion .
neurn2	cgw1ar7	1397854939	. gt obviously i agree 100 . the fact that hospitals are forced to treat people is insane what kind of free country is this . a country i and most americans want to live in . even the most selfish libertarian should advocate for this . what if you are one of those who is covered but your insurance card was n't found after you were in a bad wreck and the hospital just dumped you out back because it was obvious you would take thousands of dollars of work to fix . this whole bill was passed by reagan for fsms sake . seriously if this bothers you move to a country that does n't do this . it will hurt us more than you but we ll manage .
neurn2	chcgk4a	1399521209	. oh but here s where it gets really frustrating . conservatives many of whom benefit from those programs hate the govt . it s completely crazy talk best summed up by keep your government hands off my medicare . sigh . they ll be talking about the evils of obamacare as they demand the govt increase their kykinect subsidy . with . no . hint . of . understanding . and liberals are too spineless to make conservatives pay for their nonsense .

neurn2	cimn59d	1404312994	. i m not implying i m saying your inablilty to get pregnant and give birth means you should n't be so sure of yourself on this matter . i also believe in protecting life but you and i differ on where life begins . for me if it ca n't survive outside the womb it is n't alive . but more importantly i do n't make it my mission to impose my beliefs on others . i would n't force a person like you to get an abortion but you would try and force a woman to give birth to a fetus with no brain . or you might be like ireland where a mother died because they religiously refused to do an abortion . now both are dead . that s my problem .
neurn2	cl4mn45	1412854449	. that article was pretty iffy and did n't conclusively say she did or did n't . also it did n't say she voted in person unlikely or absentee likelier while dead . if it was actual fraud and not a mistake as the article makes clear is possible then it was probably done through absentee ballot which id laws do nothing about .
neurn2	ci7o6bc	1402785007	. see again you are unwilling to ask if the amount of debt we have today is actually too much . you just assert that because it is bigger it is badder to oversimplify . in pure dollar amount i have more debt than my grandparents at my age but guess what . as a ratio of my income i m better off . this empire hyperbole is exactly what i m talking about from tpartiers . i can assure you that the us will last far beyond your life time just like it has outlasted all the conservatives predicting its doom since nearly the founding . check out the nonsense spewed during the great depression just before arguably america s finest hour . in short this extreme hyperbole and unwillingness to look at facts from the right is a massive problem .
neurn2	clx91s2	1415511125	. the tyranny of the left . you get a tax credit if you get private health insurance . you do n't if you do n't . is buying a house a tyranny of the left too . i mean you get a tax credit for that too . how about having kids . big ol left wing tax credit tyranny there right . there are many injustices tyrannies in your speak and one of them is being unable to get health insurance converge because you got sick . also many studies have shown that increases are less than before so your 15 was probably much more before . i personally had 2 years in a row of 100 increases in the good ol days republicans are so desperate to return to . so take your tax credit or do n't . also the republican base gets a nice chunk of my paycheck each month for medicare and i may never get to use it . the only good idea would have been to let people who pay for medicare use it along with their families . but that would be socialism somehow .
neurn2	cfx463o	1394235793	. a decent analysis and he might have a point if some states had not gone out of their way in 2004 to explicitly ban something that does n't exist . ironically that effort has at least given utah and oklahoma gay marriage earlier probably than the ones that did n't touch the subject .
neurn2	cjug1c3	1408446224	. they left out some facts and evidence on that day like the autopsy report . they were trying to get the public to turn against the guy before they released the report . they could have released everything at the same time and that might have been okay . but this seemed designed to justify the shooting without releasing the details everyone wanted the shooting autopsy .
neurn2	cipaqhl	1404589388	. you are proving my point . why is reproductive health any different than heart health . it should n't be . it s all one package when you separate it from the issues both sexes face it is simple misogyny . edit agree with dentistry it s a major problem that directly affects well being and diseases .
neurn2	cn8q20z	1419892534	. well it has traditionally been the way you build a conservative coalition in america so hard to blame him . oh wait no its not what a tool . ca n't wait until being part of the gay marriage bans is on par with being an open racist . but both parties are the same so its all good why bother voting .
neurn2	clsn15k	1415111223	. maybe but they could cow the media into submission by insisting it be called the aca and then take credit for it if they wanted to . but they do n't so its a bit odd . the tell will be if a bill is proposed that strips the medical device tax and the capital gains tax increase .
neurn2	cieb9nt	1403471999	. to me the thing far more annoying than the made up scandals of the right is a left with no ability to shove the rights nose in the giant mess they left on the carpet . it should be easy and straightforward but no . the left leaps every time the right finds a scandal and treats it like its real . sherrod comes to mind and acorn .
neurn2	clo5xxp	1414677834	. i m not sure the point you are making . if you did n't want to show an id to exercise your right you could have done a private party sale . it s only because you wanted to go to a dealer you had to show an id right . again the problem is n't the id per se . its the effort required by those who normally do n't need one . gun ownership does n't require you to show the id each time you use the gun or to purchase one if you do n't want to .
neurn2	cg81n76	1395376810	. goes against the narrative . the young are supposed to be all bootstrappy . but god forbid you try to cut republican voters govt funded health care you know medicare the insurance program that i pay into but ca n't use unless i live to double my age .
neurn2	cg8ibd4	1395430757	. i agree with you but since it has already happened then we have to work from a different set of priors . since states have explicitly singled out groups of individuals for special not in a good way treatment we ca n't say what should have been . because simply it was n't . now then you think gay marriage has been a flurry of outrage just wait until the apocalyptic explosion when teh evil liberultarians try to take away marriage . .
neurn2	cjfplr3	1407078794	. ha bullshit . they happily offered two of the birth control systems before mean ol obama made them offer it and seem to have slept just fine at night . if they really had values they would be willing to suffer for them and become a non-profit or simply not offer health insurance perfectly legal . instead they had to assert themselves over their female employees for jesus reasons that are completely lacking in the bible and have no scientific basis . corporations do n't have a conscience that s a completely insane thing to give a corporation . they are a legal entity that has to follow the laws or used to . they have a right to exercise their beliefs right up until they infringe on other peoples rights under the law well that used to be true . its a brave new world .
neurn2	cga97kf	1395627838	. i would suggest something more like a green party that ran in d and r primaries . not so much to poison the well as move the overton window . i would hope a left wing version would be less rhetoric and more action items that could be discussed unlike tparty ideas which are all emotional and lack specifics except banning abortion and obamacare .
neurn2	clc1gll	1413554361	. no . this talking point needs to stop . it s complete nonsense.marriage is absolutely not a just religious institution . religion has its take on marriage but in the context that is relevant to our society it is first and foremost a civil contract . here s how you can tell . no one cares if you do purely religious ceremonies like communion . people do care about marriage . govts have been involved with marriage since recorded history .
neurn2	chxogiv	1401758186	. like i said no realistic plan . it says so right in the article . thy could have worked with dems to get something feasible passed tax increase cuts but no . they went to the conservative fantasy world and proposed something their own base would have flipped over . notice how no one talks about this plan anymore . it was unserious then and still is .
neurn2	clvbjg5	1415325066	. everyone is getting this all wrong he s bragging about how incredibly successful the republicans have been in achieving their long term goals . should read u.s is the least socially and economically mobile in developed world . gushes jeb bush also if 16 is bush v clinton i will lose it .
neurn2	cjt6r9j	1408325783	. argle bargle . hey we ve got data from all over the world and massachussettes remember that guy the rs ran for pres that these types of plans work . it s here and it s not going away because it serves a need . i do love the two sidedness of republicans who bend over backwards to give old people free coverage the early part d recipients sure as hell did n't pay for it and then lose their shit when people like me who pay for part d also get some coverage protections . but that dead horse is just laying there asking for it so keep it up 16 s gon na be a political bloodbath .
neurn2	chfigzr	1399850993	. since facts are have long stopped being important in this discussion dems need to go on the offense and nail republicans for refusing to pay to upgrade security when requested . every attack by rs should be met with why did you think money was more important than our ambassador and citizens .
neurn2	chkb4fz	1400337720	. worth pointing out that a coalition of democrats one of my senators included is trying to get a bill called the the open internet preservation act out there . it might be worthwhile to put your support behind it and encourage your reps to do the same . stupidly enough tweeting it and facebooking it is n't the worst idea as it shows what people care about . .
neurn2	cfx40rj	1394235433	. here s the thing . it s insanely easy to see if fraud like this actually occurs . okay follow along . person a registers to vote . person b claims to be person a and votes for a . person a shows up sees their name crossed off files a report . person a does not just say oh well and go home . now lets count the grand total of those reports . is it 0 . weird . i thought it was rampant .
neurn2	cg3xheo	1394978321	. the really important point of all this is that to a modern conservative the only value or drag you provide to society is monetary . a person raising the next generation of scientists that could cure cancer is a drag if they do so with even a dime of public assistance and they are lacking of moral character . meanwhile wealthy heirs and heiresses are free of any moral judgements and we can not tax them despite never earning a single dime through their own efforts .
Sollexs	ckxod05	1412188634	. by that case all the people you view as a danger also can view you as a danger and by causing harm to people who are not trying to harm you you are more of a danger to them than they are to you . then the police have the right to stop you as well as anyone who you try to harm . so basicly your using roundabout logic to argue a criminal is not a criminal while you try to argue against the use of a weapon against a criminal . it does not work that way .
Sollexs	ckxp339	1412189929	. fair enough but my question to you is this can you definitely say that the usa will never go full north korea on us . what i mean by that is this fully restricting the first amendment to pro-government speak only . if the 2ed amendment is not a natural right then the 1rst amendment is not either so both could in theory be taken away which has happened in some governments over the years . who is to say that we are a special snowflake in all of history that nothing bad will ever happen to our government . the more they circumvent the constitution the more the younger generations are ok with this the closer to a government that we do n't want becoming reality .
Sollexs	ch48wi2	1398704576	. i agree with you and am also a millennial that is very centralist over all but i am a gun owner . i think it is easy to have a armed yet safe society as most people that i interact with at the range are some of the nicest people you will ever meet . often times when i go to the range people are more than willing to let me fire a few rounds from their exotic weapons and i am also willing to let basically anyone fire a few rounds from mine . the criminals who disobey laws to begin with are the only problem and that problem will never be fixed with gun laws but by fixing our society . after all i live north of chicago where someone gets killed by guns at least once a day and guns are basically banned from there . as they say a armed society is a polite society .
Sollexs	cjkn23u	1407516454	. i do understand what you mean but one of the other problems is not just police vs bad guy but also bad guy vs bad guy . as a rival gang gets more rifles and other larger weapons then the first gang would also get more so disarming the cops while nice in theory would not work imo . as for assault weapons very few are used in crimes today and they are not as powerful as a hunting rifle . many people do n't understand what an assault rifle is let alone the anti-gun s made up term assault weapon . an assault rifle is a fully automatic or burst fire weapon firing more than one bullet per trigger pull and while are legal to own you need to go through the nfa tax stamp process to get one and because the gov ended the registry in 1986 no new full autos can be owned by civilians causing the existing ones to skyrocket in price the cheapest full auto you can get a mac10 costs around 5000 a m16 style rifle costs around 20,000 and the cheapest full auto 5.56 rifle is still in the 6,000 range . since the nfa act of 1934 only 3 legal assault rifles have been used in crimes one of which was by a cop . several illegally modified rifles semi autos gunsmited into full autos its surprisingly easy depending on the model like that bank robbery shootout in la have happened sadly but having possession of one of them or any nfa item that you do not have a tax stamp for and being caught would net you 10 years in jail so they are not that wide spread . instead the anti-gun term assault weapon really just describes cosmetic features of a gun take the two pictures below one is an assault weapon and the other is not yet they are both the same gun . . what really needs to happen is we need to help solve the massive poverty problem and doing so should help solve the gang problem . guns are a side issue that even if we got rid of them all it would not really matter as people would just take to other weapons like knifes and swords .
Sollexs	cjwjh3t	1408633145	. true . i myself have never had real training by anyone but i have been shooting all my life first gun fired was when i was 5 i am 24 currently and this happened a few years back . i do n't think it would honestly be to hard to train the cops to be a bit more accurate just make them shoot slower at further targets for some time .
Sollexs	cgeb80z	1396029959	. yea that is true . i had not thought about that as well . in that essence do you agree that to big to fail banks should have gotten the money they did . i would have rather seen them fail send a message to the rest of the banks that they ca n't do shit like this and expect to survive .
Sollexs	cmjb91p	1417559494	. its kinda funny i was not even arguing for that but people generally do n't attack people that they know have a gun for fear of getting shot as its just common sense . not saying i do n't like guns because i own many ps90 and psl54c ftw along with several ww2 rifles and pistols but i was not even referring to that when i wrote that comment .
Sollexs	clu54jx	1415228649	. i do n't use facebook so i mainly just get it from the democrats on this subreddit . i am a gun owner and because of that a lot of people on this subreddit seem to think i am a crazy right winged terrorist or something ins dick joke here despite the fact that i am fine with gay marriage i do n't have any gay friends and have been hit on by a few gay guys which kinda creeped me out but i do n't think they should not be happy women should have equal rights however i feel a lot of feminists take this to far and seem to just want men to have less rights . equal rights are equal for both sides not one over the other and the drug war needs to end now .
Sollexs	cirmwhv	1404833444	. yep 2 sides of the same coin dividing us so they do n't have to really work and debating over mostly things that do n't effect their bottom line . i mean really gay marriage is huge in the political spear . i am a bit more right leaning but i do n't give a fuck if gays can get married i have always said why not . but it is something that can be debated and either way it really does not hurt anyone s bottom line but it does hurt the gays if they ca n't . any real problems are just skirted to the side while the little problems are shouted about constantly and god forbid anything like climate change or drugs comes up they hurt the bottom line for some so they will just endlessly debate them with no solutions in sight .
Sollexs	ck28mvu	1409175678	. i bought one to do this with . . i could rip it off that mannequin and put it on in about 30 second though and have a weapon loaded and ready . not that ar on the mannequin though that thing does not even have the 223 bolt in it but a 22lr kit with a 223 magazine lol .
Sollexs	chxoj77	1401758357	. yea i do n't see a rational basis for your thought . it appears from the up votes i have gotten and the down votes you have gotten others agree with my ramblings more than yours . edit on top of everything you have yet to even tell me what reasonable limits you believe are reasonable . you have yet to make any point other than strawmaning away and trying to look good . you do n't seem to have any argument what so ever . my first post showed that most people that want to ban certin types of guns do so on a cosmetic basis and my second post says that we all ready have common sense restrictions on firearms . what you have even failed to say is why you think some guns should be restricted other than i am responsible so i believe that some should be banned which quite frankly stinks of firearms ignorance and thus makes you very irresponsible to even suggest banning more firearms because you do n't seem to understand them . please if you have a augment at all with facts do post it here . if not you do n't have a point to stand on at all other than your feelings which stop at my rights .
Sollexs	chy2gj7	1401806994	. yes and . because bridges poison knifes cars and a million other things are just as deadly to oneself if you intend to kill yourself . look at japan they have basically no guns in civilian hands yet they have suicide rates that are some of the highest in all 1st world countries . if suicide is going to happen it does not matter what tool you use .
Sollexs	ck7gq6f	1409695579	. on writing i do n't think it will be to much longer until a job like yours can be automated . sure the current bots mainly write sports articles but there are bots out there that can do complex things like writing music that sounds human and be a doctor watson . this is happening right now infact its been happening for a few years now . how long before complex writing is taking by robotics . i do n't know but it will happen . unions wo n't help us when there is more automation i know you ca n't watch the video right now but one of their points is that the great depression only had a jobless rate of around 25 while the automation we have right now working once it becomes cheaper and mass produced the main example is robotic cars so this will happen within the next 10 years they will cut out about 40 of our economic jobs . why would you have a human drive trucks when robots can do it safer and without sleep bathroom breaks and a one time upfront cost instead of a yearly amount of pay . same goes for taxis busses and basically any job that currently requires a person to drive a vehicle from one point to another including aircraft drones take off and land themselves how much longer till we have drone passenger planes . we really need to start looking for a solution that will last more than 10 years while unions may help for that time they will become irrelevant when humans are unemployable because there are simply not enough jobs .
Sollexs	cm65mjn	1416334921	. alot of people in this subreddit are like this lol . they see their ideal and cling to a politician that promises the world but never delivers . then they offer fixes that would really hurt more than it would fix thinking they are right because their politician said so . conformation bias is a strong thing .
Sollexs	cht4ez7	1401287728	. i got a 503 on your link but i agree . its generally not people in the suburbs that kill each other just the gangs in the ghettos fighting over turf that are . add to that how chicago my home city has some of the toughest gun laws out right banning them up until recently has had a higher murder rate basically at least one a day or more than most of america .
Sollexs	ch4e8iv	1398715320	. you ca n't draw all gun owners with the same stick in fact i am all for reducing poverty and more education . the problem is that america has been put in such an us vs them mentality and we as a country are so divided there is no way for any of these real issues to be dealt with as that is what keeps us voting for one side or the other . i am not a republican or a liberal i voted 3rd party last election as i did not like either candidate . i know there are dumb people on both the conservative and liberal sides of this debate a debate that really just distracts us from the real problems because banning firearms and even more gun laws at this point wo n't do anything to stop violence because guns are not the problem their violent use is a symptom of a much larger problem .
Sollexs	cmhapjw	1417384527	. you know it really seems like democrats mostly are closed minded and do n't seem to see reality but in stead they see their me world and think that if anyone disagrees with them that person is automatically wrong . it so funny to see all the people that are drowning in kool-aid at this point .
Sollexs	chdvjgt	1399663447	. true true but when we get to that level of automation i would hope our education system gets good enough to make it not as big of a task . fixing computers is not that hard and add mechanical things to the mix with a decent manual and someone in high school should be able to fix it we are not designing new things but replacing warn parts software upgrades . hell i was fixing computers and setting up high end cisco routers via cli while setting up business grade networks in a highschool class . but the second part of your question employing less people is the hard part . i think at that point we would really need something like basic income to continue as the jobless rate will keep increasing as the cost of robotics goes down and complexity of tasks able to be completed increases .
Sollexs	cht3ylr	1401286666	. not just criminals need more money more like criminals just make them out of stuff you get at ace hardware . its quite easy to make a sten sub machine gun from a pipe and a few blocks of metal if you have some metal working equipment it was designed that way for mass production . i am sure a gang could setup a metal working shop and crank out firearms .
Sollexs	ch4bfod	1398709712	. i re-read it just for you . all i see is them saying newtown 2 times and saying they took a lot of veribles to make a conclusion that they even said needs further study . you do realize that you can manipulate numbers and statistics to say anything right . .
Sollexs	cjkxdqb	1407535911	. yes very true . also suppressors are not regulated in england in fact they are suggested to cut down on noise from firing ranges . also short barreled rifles and shotguns are not privy to extra regulations in canada lol . maybe if the anti gunners would compromise and let us take suppressors and short barreled weapons off the nfa list we can talk about some of what they want . i always find it funny how the anti-gun crowd yells at the pro gun crowd and says you never compromise when the fact that there are gun laws show we compromise but the fact that they never give back shows they are in fact the ones who do not .
Sollexs	ckk4m33	1410895393	. well one the rifles part of my argument stems from the assault weapons front where all rifles kill less people than hands feet but i digress . yes 2/3rds of all murders in the us are caused by firearms but i do not believe for a second that if we somehow took all firearms away ie 0 gun deaths in this example we would not have 2/3rds less murders . guns are a tool of choice due to their ease of use sure .
Sollexs	chy2tkf	1401807840	. i take you have no experiance with guns . just an fyi its not as easy to hit a target as you seem to think without a lot of practice . moving targets can be quite hard to hit and just spraying bullets all over will likely result in many misses . you should not discuss things you are not familiar with fyi feelings do not trump facts and the guns you see in movies are far from reality .
Sollexs	chy3pmr	1401809818	. no its your complete lack of mental capacity that makes you think that the concept of guns is just to kill . guns are a force equalizer it is the only thing in the world that will let a 90lbs girl stand up to a 200lbs guy and win so she does not get harmed or raped . yes the tool known as a gun s purpose is to fling metal rocks at high speeds inflicting harm on whatever the metal rock touches however to defend oneself you do n't even have to fling said metal rock as the brandishing of a metal rock flinger is enough to scare away most attackers . i will let the former co-anchor of 20/20 john stossel do my half of the argument for me as he is able to elaborate with more authority than i do n't worry its a short 5 min video .
Sollexs	cix40kf	1405352643	. i am in the same boat . there are some conservative policies i like and there are democratic policies that i like but over all both parties do not seem to be out for the general well being of the majority of americans . i would argue that it seems like both parties pander to the rich despite the democrat s image of pandering to the poor . this will continue until we get money out of politics sadly .
Sollexs	cjkqc26	1407522383	. true but just because some people are unsafe does not mean we all get deprived of something . try limiting it from the unsafe people i am fine with that but most weapons laws do n't limit to anyone else than the people who obey them and they are generally the people who are safe with em .
Sollexs	chy2cr9	1401806743	. for suicides the way the person died does not matter there are a million ways one could kill themselves and no defensive gun uses are in the 60 thousand or so per year or more who reports a crime that does not happen . while suicides are in the 20k . you have your stat reversed .
Sollexs	citxem3	1405030685	. well 2 things here . 1 if you make it requiring a fee for general people they will just ignore the law . 2 . if they make an online form it would practically cost nothing after the initial development cost over what it does cost now . they could make money off the ffls or even a small amount when you use the online form i would be fine with a 5 10 fee . really requiring a ffl to do the check is the problem imo more so than a fee . you want people to use this system to stop criminals no .
Sollexs	cl52olh	1412888648	. well i belive in some liberal ideals and i belive in some republican ideals . i remeber a time in history class my teacher gave out a sheet with political ideals and then we all checked off what we agreed on and what we did not on . after we did a class vote and our class came out as being for the proposed ideas on the sheet then she congratulated us for being in line with the nazis . the real problem is the simple fact that not everyone will be 100 with either party so they just have to choose between which of their ideals are more important to them someone being liberal on one idea or a few does not necessarily make them a liberal that is just too broad of a stroke to use .
Sollexs	cgvvds1	1397842328	. most protests the protesters do n't come armed and lately most protests seem to be dispersed by police with full riot gear and military weapons . i honestly do n't think they will lead by example in the unarmed sense because they are leading by example in the armed sense although the government ca n't just push people around like they have been when they are armed . though i as a gun owner 100 agree with what you want edit for clarity i want no fighting from either side i just do n't see it happening on the gov s part no matter how much we hope for it to be true .
Sollexs	ch4b3l0	1398709019	. yea i agree that a simulated firefight is nothing like the real thing but its as close as i can get to the real thing without being the real thing and basically the same way police and military train for the real thing so its got to count for something . i do agree with your second statement things can and would get messy but what makes me think the police wo n't just shoot on sight is the aurora theater shooting where the gunman that was doing the shooting surrendered to the police and he was not shot . that and how like you said most gunmen kill themselves when faced by police i do n't think the police would be trying to kill a gunman before the gunman kills himself more that they would only do that if they found the gunman firing or attempting to fire at civilians or police . if i was stuck in a shootout then i would not just be running in the open like an idiot i would be taking shots from behind cover and moving from cover to cover as much as i could to avoid getting shot .
Sollexs	cm67yse	1416338938	. 1 . you insulted me several times over the course of our talk . i had not insulted you until after you had done it to me . 2 . you have brought 0 proof just anecdotal claims to which you basically say are common sense . 3 reality does not work in the way you describe . yes if a school allocates its money properly and brings class sizes down it can help but school is not 100 responsible for this and it can never be unless you remove the people from their homes . the home environment has as much if not more to do with how people are brought up than schools . if the solution where as simple as you say then it would work across the board and i have already proven that to be false with my simple wiki links . i am still waiting on one tiny tincy bit of proof because all i have gotten from you is anecdotal evidence claiming causality that is not even supported by the evidence i have brought up while insulting me the entire argument . how you do not seem understand this is beyond me and further proves the point of the original person i replied to .
Sollexs	ch4c98o	1398711390	. i do n't blindly support anyone i do however own firearms and know that non-criminals tend not to use them in to hurt others . i am against most of the new anti firearms laws on account of they would do nothing to stop criminals and only hurt law abiding citizens . if you want to ban all firearms then you will have to have a constitutional convention to get the 2ed amendment taken out but until you can tell me with 100 confidence that criminals will no longer have firearms i will not give mine up . also when we stop having people like these .
Sollexs	ch4b8h0	1398709296	. the other problem here how many of the suicides would have stopped because the one who wanted to die did not have a gun . japan would like to have a word with you there . and the accidents well they are so low why are we even worried about them when much much more pressing issues are at hand . maybe idiots should lock up their weapons when they know people who do n't know how to handle firearms safely are in their household but that is just like trying to prevent kids from stealing their parents car keys and going for joyrides or stopping kids from climbing trees because they can fall out of them . i do not live in a bubble you do and your facts are extremely biased .
Sollexs	ckjzkxx	1410886352	. no it does not make it ok there should be a focus on the real problem not the tool used . as for your second point fair enough . i do n't know why there are less gun homicides in the uk but there is no factual link between gun laws and gun crimes .
Sollexs	cmd0zun	1416954490	. i fully agree and people should learn the basics of gun safety before even handling a gun but how do you really mandate that in a good way . all of the gun safty really needed would fit in a 3 leaf pamphlet with large pictures and room to spare but it wo n't stop everything . i think its fairly good that out of 300 million guns we have only 600 fatalities with probably not much more accidents thats much less than 1 and i do n't think we could really reduce it any more .
Sollexs	cm8e0gb	1416522685	. i do n't quite understand . i do n't expect any president to be perfect but if he is truly lenient than he could even do one or 2 of the things i said above . hell even just trying to change the national conversation about it would be enough however i remember he last denounced legalization for at least during his term .
Sollexs	chyb9mk	1401825381	. this is true . i wo n't discount a large stick as it can be a very deadly weapon if used correctly . but if i got one or two good slashes in with the knife it would diminish your strength much more than a good handful of hits granted there are spots like the neck that could get me fairly easy .
Sollexs	chy3zyz	1401810446	. well never herd that about ron paul before lol . i am not so worried about the right wing extremists if they really try to do anything we will just have another waco atf raid . who is papa doc btw . the government already has a massive arsenal to control us and honestly if some crazy right wing group tried to take over anything in my town i would be handing out part of my arsenal to anyone willing to help stop them police that are under-armed included granted at this point they should not be and standing right along side our boys in blue with my own personal firearms and armor .
Sollexs	cmcojbe	1416933081	. that does not matter to the anti-gun crowd like the poster above they believe that if they are banned they will just go away and no one will have them you know like drugs its not like a gun can last over 100 years if it is half way decently taken care of oh wait .
Sollexs	chy2k7f	1401807238	. no they are not the reason why . gang violence is one of the main reasons why and that is mostly caused by our war on drugs . please tell me why we have 300,000,000 or more guns in this country yet we have only around 11,000 people murdered by guns a year and the tool is the problem . we also have many more people than all of western europe put together . edit spelling .
Sollexs	cj6p3m6	1406227045	. i do n't think we should take the idea to try and change it back to how it was after all the climate has been changing throughout the life of the earth . we should start preparing for the eventuality that it will happen while trying to cut down on our impact of it since that could give us more time for what is probably an inevitable change we are just speeding it up .
Sollexs	cjkqc26	1407522383	. true but just because some people are unsafe does not mean we all get deprived of something . try limiting it from the unsafe people i am fine with that but most weapons laws do n't limit to anyone else than the people who obey them and they are generally the people who are safe with em .
Sollexs	ch48y95	1398704677	. i would be fine with private sale background checks as long as its easy to do for the seller but most of the proposed laws make it so you have to go through an ffl and pay a fee . people would not bother doing that even if it was law and it still would not stop straw buyers from selling illegally as they do right now .
Sollexs	ch4amlp	1398708061	. i have been in simulated firefights and i am able to keep a calm head i doubt i would just poop myself and not be able to think but it sounds like that is how you would react . i understand police have shot people for stupid reasons but i am willing to take that chance in order to save others as well as myself in the un likely possibility that me surrendering to the police when they arrive gets me shot .
Sollexs	ck7gq6f	1409695579	. on writing i do n't think it will be to much longer until a job like yours can be automated . sure the current bots mainly write sports articles but there are bots out there that can do complex things like writing music that sounds human and be a doctor watson . this is happening right now infact its been happening for a few years now . how long before complex writing is taking by robotics . i do n't know but it will happen . unions wo n't help us when there is more automation i know you ca n't watch the video right now but one of their points is that the great depression only had a jobless rate of around 25 while the automation we have right now working once it becomes cheaper and mass produced the main example is robotic cars so this will happen within the next 10 years they will cut out about 40 of our economic jobs . why would you have a human drive trucks when robots can do it safer and without sleep bathroom breaks and a one time upfront cost instead of a yearly amount of pay . same goes for taxis busses and basically any job that currently requires a person to drive a vehicle from one point to another including aircraft drones take off and land themselves how much longer till we have drone passenger planes . we really need to start looking for a solution that will last more than 10 years while unions may help for that time they will become irrelevant when humans are unemployable because there are simply not enough jobs .
Sollexs	cmr8fi5	1418251501	. yep . same with gun control . at this point there is no way that guns are going to get banned yet the left touts gun control every second they can it seems while the right defends it every second they can . we have a lot of issues that are feelings vs facts split between both sides so each side has an item with facts and an item with feelings gun control the right has the facts gay marriage and legalization the left has the facts . this is to keep people on opposite sides of their fence and arguing about everything all while real issues get ignored . do n't read this as putting these issues down as a lot of people have very strong opinions going both ways and they are important to a lot of people they are just not issues we should be arguing about .

ArchStantonsDead	cgt6xph	1397585917	. yes . i do care about canceled policies . families had found the available policies that best fit their needs balancing cost and coverage . if a person dropped their policy and picked up another perhaps something created by the aca we can assume they did because it is a better deal for them . however if a family had their policy canceled on them because it did n't meet the aca s criteria we can assume they had not dropped it because it provided a better balance for them than do the plans offered by the aca . unless we assume that people are just too stupid to make their own decisions . premiums have been going up for years . part of the promise that the aca was sold on was actual reductions in premiums . this is in sharp contrast with the accelerating increases in premiums projected over the next few years . the loss of access to doctors and hospitals from plans in the aca is a direct result of the price points defined by the aca . the savings have to come from somewhere . in the case of access the aca is driving costs down by selling the patients to the lowest bidder . obamacare is the healthcare quality race to the bottom . so again yes . i am concerned about the dangerously poor quality of healthcare and the dangerously limited access to that poor quality healthcare promised by the aca .

ArchStantonsDead	cgbhv11	1395760641	. yes . by definition the only purpose furthered by pharmaceutical contraception is recreational sex . there are three purposes for engaging in intercourse procreation recreation and commerce . the discussion has never been about whether a prostitute s business expenses should be covered by the aca or any other federal mandate . i ll assume were not discussing the commerce scenario . pharmaceutical contraception by definition does not further the goal of procreation . it s purpose is to prevent procreation . that leaves recreation . clearly pharmaceutical contraception is intended to remove the risk of pregnancy from intercourse . further there is no other purpose for pharmaceutical contraception . the chemicals employed in pharmaceutical contraception are used in other medical interventions for endocrine system related issues and i think some cancers . these uses of the chemicals is separate from their use as pharmaceutical contraception . this is a very common scenario where a drug is covered for some uses and not others . i know of no other drug with the sole purpose of recreation being mandated by law as a part of an employer s compensation package .
ArchStantonsDead	cf9wiei	1391827023	. syria was never a threat to the us . obama forced his way into the civil war when he demanded assad step down . obama is the leader of the largest military power in the world . he order another head of state to leave assad must go . when assad defied obama on that order the trajectory was pretty well defined . obama set up the next step when he said what i really meant is that assad will not be allowed to use chemical weapons . that left assad in a cor we with only one move . he used his chemical weapons . again demonstrating military tactical and political superiority over obama . obama then responded by saying assad must go if he really really uses chemical weapons . again assad had one move and he used it . after gassing many more people . obama is again the fool and many have died for it . syria had not been a threat to the us pre-obama . but now it seems possible syria is a small but key player in the rise of a russia middle east south america axis against the us .
ArchStantonsDead	cgdrcme	1395967468	. ahh . i get your point now . you re saying the democrats wins in the last two elections were possible solely because the democrats through the irs prevented outside groups favoring republican associated policies from expressing their positions while giving fast track approval for groups favoring democratic party policies .
ArchStantonsDead	cefyckb	1388715634	. the majority of republican voters rejected the proposal during bill clinton s first presidential election . they rejected for his entire term . they rejected it right up to obama s first campaign . he proposed his plan and the majority of republican voters told him they would not accept it or anything like it . they would n't except it when the republicans first floated the idea . a democrat is not likely to convince them that they should accept it now . especially after having promised his base that if he did n't initially institute a single payer whatever he did get was a step to a single payer system . after getting into office the republicans did n't reject obamacare because he was a democrat or because he was black . they rejected obamacare because they d been rejecting it for decades and obama promised to keep do even worse if he got this . the republicans were upfront and honest in their long-standing rejection of nationalized healthcare . obama has lied about their motives beginning in his first campaign and continuing to this day .

Murgie	cjmaxh1	1407689252	. gt it is strictly because big oil is fracking . fracking itself . nah you could pump thousands of gallons of substance literally composed of every caustic chemical you might find in the average janitors closet with a pinch of salt and a few radioactive isotopes thrown in for good measure if you really wanted to . you ll eventually see some adverse effects on the biosphere if you do it enough but nothing on a scale that s going to measurably alter global temperature . tailings reservoirs and the like are a different matter having a drastically more immediate effect on the surrounding environment but not in a way which strongly contributes to the greenhouse effect so it s really a whole different matter . in short the act of frakking itself is n't uniquely responsible for any major climate changing effects that any other method of harvesting fossil fuels would n't be . the problem is what we do with the stuff we just pumped out of the ground with whatever substance we use the oil or natural gas or whatever we happen to be harvesting however we happen to be harvesting it . fuels could literally just appear in our gas tanks every morning no effort whatsoever required to extract it . because of what common fossil fuels are made of . this carbon in turn bonds with oxygen in the air and becomes atmospheric carbon dioxide . some things contain and/or give off methane too which is a far more powerful greenhouse gas but such fuels simply are n't consumed by society at nearly the same rate as those which give off co2 . gt how can you subjectively pinpoint one or two specific things car emissions etc . as the source of rapid climate change one of the most conclusive forms of evidence in my opinion anyway is core sampling . when dealing obscenely long periods of time on a scale of millions of years rock coring similar to that detailed in the linked article is used . for a quick example say you re taking a meter long core sample from the bottom of a lake in the badlands . when you ve taken it back to your lab to examine it you find that there s a 30cm section of the rock that s rich in what s found to be coal . well then congratulations from this alone we can pretty definitively stay that for a period of time there was abundant organic life consisting of at least plankton krill algae and the like in that lake . then something changed and everything in the lake died off . if we have data showing that one cm of rock is equivalent to 1000 years of sediment and the 30cm of coal infused rock is located 50cm down the 100cm long core then we know that approximately 80,000 years ago life found its way into that lake and 50,000 years ago it all died out . how does that all relate to the relatively small time frame that humans have been around and the even smaller one since we invented the engine . well that s where arctic and antarctic ice core sampling . it s pretty much the same as rock coring except ice forms much quicker and is so porous that it actually contains measurable quantities of the atmosphere from the time it was frozen at . ice is even easier to date with extreme accuracy because the slight melting and refreezing of the ice each year leaves a visible segment in the layering of the ice . here s a good example . and here s that same example at an absurdly high resolution . from that we can tell just what was in the atmosphere that year . because its so easy to figure out what is from where we can actually see major atmospheric changes which it turns out always coincide with both major environmental events and changes in human activity . like in this core here . i hope that helps answer some of your questions mate .

ctindel	cj8kekh	1406405249	. i was n't encouraging their behavior of shutting off water and i think access to clean water is a basic human right . i often say that a city government has a single basic function getting clean water in and getting waste water out . everything on top of that is icing on the cake . i was merely saying that if the law provided for a more orderly way of clearing slums say by giving current residents a deed in the newly redeveloped property you would n't see people doing what they re doing .

ctindel	clf3eqc	1413849388	. what choice would they have when corporations and entrepreneurs inside america would be producing that shit in modern labs at cut rate prices . there s a reason liquor distributors are n't shooting each other in the street with tommy guns anymore . we legalized that shit and now billion dollar corporations are running it . great they pay taxes and produce products with known ingredients and purities .
ctindel	cn08vp7	1419050690	. talk to me when they re in favor of all legalization . i just watched the drugs inc episode on meth today . people are driving in liquid form meth and producing i dont even know how many thousands of pounds a day and they follow the oakland pd on a raid that must be 10 officers and an armored tank to confiscate less than a pound . and i doubt they do a bust like that every day . talk about the very definition of a wasted activity assuming your goal is keeping meth off the streets .
ctindel	cgr7w9f	1397389820	. you say that would kill the industry like its a bad thing . like legalizing alcohol killed a massive revenue stream for organized crime . we have an alternative that could be instituted in fairly short order which is giving everybody medicare . the systems are already in place though the agencies would need to staff up to handle the increased load on the system . luckily there would be some people familiar with medical billing looking for work .
ctindel	cel8iwa	1389270985	. i do n't think anybody is saying that it is good for kids or that kids should have it . though i do find it absolutely absurd that our government will give an 18 year old kid a gun to go kill people in afghanistan but wo n't let them buy a beer .
ctindel	clpnwyo	1414803939	. municipal water tends to be extremely high quality and inexpensive . it certainly would not cost less if it were privatized . we also get damn good sewer and trash service roads and highways are pretty great too and they clog up a lot less without toll plazas . i wish more cities would get into the internet game .
ctindel	cllb1pq	1414432211	. typically you could do it by taking a class at a junior college . if you do n't have the money there are student loans available they can help you with this and since it s a junior college and not a 4-year program it wo n't leave you saddled with a shitload of debt . they will also be able to hook you up with people who you can apprentice under . it s hard work but there s not a glut of people who do it because most high school kids are focused on university for all the reasons that we always talk about on reddit . once you make enough to start your own business and employ people you can make a shit load of money at it .
ctindel	cjteu1z	1408347601	. why the democrats do n't make this their main talking point every day for the next 10 years is beyond me . every intelligent person who ever makes a tv appearance should say the words if you vote republican and make less than 5m a year then you are voting against your own best interests . maybe if people hear it tens of thousands of times it will start to sink in .
ctindel	cj8kbfb	1406405049	. gt stories like that make me think twice about the idea of participating in a hoa down the road . sure you could choose to live in a neighborhood without one but then you have no recourse when your neighbor does n't take care of his property or house and it drags down the value of your property with it . it is n't just about taking good care of the communal space though there is that too .
ctindel	cn753q6	1419742264	. if 50 million people each donate 20 how much money would that raise . i mean it you do n't need money from wall street and pacs if you can really unite the middle class especially since middle class white people wo n't be scared off by him and anybody who is wary of a female president would have this as an alternative . i know hillary is more than qualified but i will still be surprised to see this country elect a female president before we have a female vice president .
ctindel	cjyqpr4	1408841308	. see that s the problem . people are so concerned about crime even though we have historically low levels of crime at the moment . with the exception of very bad neighborhoods in chicago etc you are more at risk driving alone in your car than you are walking down the street . why are people so scared that they ll allow the government to spy on them . every single instance of a government spying on its own people nazi germany gdr communist russia modern china etc has turned the government itself into a virtual terrorist organization against its own people . why are people so afraid .
ctindel	cfxxx7y	1394334455	. sure you can fire a teacher for cause . but its pretty hard to fire a mediocre teacher . one who shows up on time every day dressed properly and teaches the lesson plan but in a way that totally fails to inspire their students . we ve all had those teachers and while they re not the bottom of the barrel they re taking up a spot of someone who might try harder in that position .
ctindel	cl3ua3q	1412783422	. you almost certainly can not afford a 3 bedroom anything in nyc if you make that kind of paltry income . have you seen the kind of taxes you pay in ny state . if you live in nyc you get to pay extra city income tax on top of that .
ctindel	clzvr36	1415750530	. do n't even get me started . i mean even 15 is pretty good for 2 hours of entertainment and when i was single i just brought my own food and drinks . now the so always wants to have popcorn soda etc . relative to other possible dates it s still not crazy expensive i just hate overpaying for something that in any other setting would be much cheaper .
ctindel	clvknq4	1415348395	. gt so how is it with jobs . like do you still have to take a drug test for it or what . you can still be fired for smoking on personal time . examples include discharging an employee for filing a worker s compensation claim bringing or threatening a lawsuit serving on a jury engaging in lawful off-duty activities refusing to commit perjury whistleblower situations etc .
LockeClone	cf0zp5b	1390926688	. ugh . so federal employees are traditionally supposed to make less than their private sector counterparts . however while federal jobs have done a better job staying unionized and keeping wages better tied to inflation the private sector has gone to shit . public sector wages have suffered too but not to the extent the private sector has . my point is that public sector wages more closely represent where wages and benefits should be or where we should expect them to be . i think the president recognizes this and is attempting to protect the public s weining expectation for decent wages . i personally believe that this is a losing battle and more drastic and all-encompassing wage reforms are necessary .
LockeClone	cmj4sow	1417548898	. yeah every negative outcome is pounced on and heavily publicized by union busters so it s worth noting that the vast majority of these issues are righteous . i mean when i was young i worked in the service industry and lost hundreds of dollars every year to working while clocked out . my complaints to hr got me disciplined rather than satisfied . when i multiply was was taken from me by all the employees around me and possibly millions more around the country we re looking at an insanely massive theft from people that can not afford to be stolen from . if anybody needs representation it s those poor people .
LockeClone	chtbz4b	1401303396	. while i agree that quite a few liberal programs need to be reworked i do n't believe that s the problem . the problem is more based in subsidizing and not taxing appropriately groups and corporations that have no need of aid . i ll point at walmart . when they do n't pay their employees a living wage taxpayers have to pick up the slack . why should n't that slack come directly out of the shareholders pockets . either that or legislate laws that make paying a non-living wage impossible . then there s general loopholes and ridiculous deductions . why not legislate a progressive threshold that demands a hard percent no matter what the claims are .
LockeClone	cmj2jb7	1417545077	. it s definitely better than our system because cost is controlled in a way that makes sense for the body politic but it still assumes that insurance companies are somehow more innovative than an equivalent public entity . i would be inclined to agree in other industries but i just do n't see why competing insurance is a positive thing . what are these companies innovating . why not single payer .
LockeClone	cmkff4u	1417650674	. i do n't follow what you re asking . if technological unemployment increases which it most certainly will the overall size of the population matters not because demand is more based on percentages than straight numbers . if you have a population of 10 and each person needs a toilet and it takes two workers to fill that demand reducing the population to five does mean you only need one toilet maker but it s the same level of employment . increase the population to 20 and now you need 4 toilet makers . population is not a factor in this equation .
LockeClone	cmiw27q	1417533123	. gt i hope they manage to shut down the government . i hope they repeal obamacare . i hope they achieve every stupid ambition they could ever dream and sign every piece of legislation alec puts in front of their faces . just so these whiners learn a fucking lesson . there s part of me that really wants to believe this that if the neocons get everything they want they ll fuck it all up and we ll come to our senses . but i really think that the only thing that would happen is things would go to hell and then the neo-neocons would just insist that if the taxes were just allowed to be a little lower and the wealthy were allowed to just be a little more unobstructed everything would get better . the dark ages lasted for a thousand years for a lot of cultures not because of bad government and social policies . i do n't think there s light at the end of this tunnel unless we fight for it tooth and nail now .
LockeClone	chtgeet	1401312328	. i think the lending practices of giving vast sums of money to kids with no income or assets is ridiculous . student loans should have a half-life of a few years and if the student fails to pay it off then that s on the lender for making a bad bet . you make those laws and you ll see a lot less debt issues . and guess what . the elite still need an educated servant class so they should pay for it and absolutely would if they had to .
LockeClone	cmpowzk	1418131889	. sure we can pay our workers union wages . it s easy ready . step one pay them better wages . thats it . done . because the greedy wont do this on their own we could increase bargaining rights or raise minimum wage or do a ubi . so many solutions to this problem .
LockeClone	chzbb0v	1401920694	. it s certainly not the american dream but that s very dead for people of my generation . i used to think i could never live comfortable below a certain threshold until i started having to tighten my belt one luxury item at a time . and alas . life is still pretty sweet but i do n't wish it on anyone .
LockeClone	cm926yl	1416588785	. your experience of making a decent wage . poor baby . if you really feel like your income bracket should n't be the tipping point because the money has to come from somewhere does n't it . then you should probably start convincing your conservative friends that nationalized care or nationalized insurance is the way to go then more of the burden is pushed up the progressive tax bracket . why do you think single-payer is so repugnant to them in the first place . aca is an overly complicated mess and it s not a great plan but for way more people than you it s a literal life saver myself included . so you ll have to forgive me if i could give two shits about you making more money than i do and having to put a little bit back into the pot for your fellow countrymen .
LockeClone	ckr2obt	1411547556	. gt according to your logic no business that does n't involve heavy government regulation is moral unless all of the employees are millionaires . did you pull this out of tin air or am talk radio . gt you part about the average uber employee is pathetic . do you honestly think you can just make up things like that and expect to win your argument . i ve worked for both lyft and uber in the la area and know plenty of other people who have and currently do . you can make 20/hr during peak hours which equates to about 15.25 after gas and w amp t during normal hours monday-thursday and weekends during the day i usually made between 10 15/hr . add gas and w amp t and you dip below minimum . i once had a four hour stint with two tiny fares and made about 12 the entire time . gt prove it . show us their employee marketing plan and data on current employees . for some reason after reading your post i expect it to be written in crayon . first of all do n't be a dick . your dickishness changed this from a conversation to an argument and i doubt you ll even read this far into my post . second i m not an executive at these companies so sadly i do n't have charts and graphs to show you . i can tell you that the per/mile fees changed almost weekly especially with lyft . they re young and competitive and do n't know where the line is yet . the problem with them dialing in a competitive number with uber is that the race to the bottom harms drivers . furthermore if these businesses make taxi services obsolete then we ve just axed tens of thousands of jobs that pay pretty well in exchange for a couple thousand jobs that pay much worse . if this was just happening in the transportation world we could say it s just the times but it s happening rapidly in almost every labor sector of the economy . the result is a hollowing out of wages followed by wealth for the vast majority of americans . regardless of how talking heads feel about how things aughtta be run i do n't think many of us want to live in an america where the only jobs available for our children are service-industry slogs that pay little and pile all liability onto the laborers .
LockeClone	cg8aqum	1395414871	. it s an algorithm that assesses risk based on many factors but the exact details are n't public . the system also performs it s checks based on name identification meaning if one john smith lands on the no-fly list then every john smith will run into trouble . anecdotally daniel brown a us marine returning from iraq could n't board the flight home because his name matched on on the list . ted kennedy was on it for a while as was robert j johnson . the list goes on . the other issue is that no-fly listers are n't notified of their status . the just show up at the airport and are told to go away with no refund . personally i d lose my job it that happened . another huge issue is that no-fly listers are told after bening denied air travel that their status can not be confirmed or denied and thus can not be appealed . i get that you probably think i m a bleeding-heart liberal or something but i do n't have a problem with the fact that a no-fly list exists . i have a problem with the fact that it exists outside of and above the law . the right way to do it would be to notify the subject that he/she is now on the list and give an appeal date less than a month out and enlist a judge with the appropriate clearance level to certify the charges . the current method of blacklisting individuals without having to present evidence and without allowing the charged to speak on his/her behalf is unamerican and flaunts authoritarianism in the face of a supposed representative democracy .
LockeClone	chzlmup	1401945952	. i answered a broad question i did n't seek to write the policy . however if these needs are not met then eventually the worker will become a drag oh his family or the state when he gets a health problem or something else happens . again if we were a country where low wage jobs were few and opportunities were just a little boot-strappin away then sure it s probably his fault . work harder or a little smarter . but wages are at such an abysmal low and labor has no bargaining power due to the scarcity of jobs that the american worker needs to be protected and empowered . the american worker s well-being needs to be prioritized before that of industry . raising the minimum wage will raise wages for most of the american workforce indirectly and if it frees some up to quit their second or third job then you will also increase general labor bargaining power by lowering job scarcity .
LockeClone	cg37bfx	1394891305	. gt i m so glad liberals support making it more difficult for middle americans to save for their own retirement because they want to punish those they are jealous of . do n't be that guy zenitram . it s true that some liberals are fueled by the bitterness and want to take other people down a peg but those people are just as nauseating as conservatives who have the ridiculous notion that people who do n't think like them want to destroy this country . think motivation dude . if i work hard my whole life go to school pay my taxes etc . and have very little to show for it meanwhile the news has been screaming for years that we have apocalyptic debt that i had nothing to do with and a huge booming sector of our economy that did have a role in creating the debt is shouldering none of the burden . it s like i m being stolen from . i do n't want to hurt them i really do n't give a damn about them i just want them to share the burden so i do n't have to pay off the debt they created with my shitty hourly job that nets me peanuts compared to what they do . i know it s more complicated than that but stop thinking everyone who does n't think like you is evil .
LockeClone	cmjv7pa	1417613416	. you get so used to saying something and then one day it turns out not to be true . this actually is n't surprising for so many reasons and i bet we ll see other countries beating us out in this too . i work av for clinical meetings and get to see many fun infographics about how to treat obesity and where it s most prevalent . basically if rural america was n't so destitute and was slightly more educated about health we could be a very healthy country .
LockeClone	cmiv2rf	1417530829	. gt i ll be shocked if they get this up and going without some lawsuits coming their way . but the vote is n't to force the other companies out it s just to allow the municipalities to build their own as an alternative choice . we re in a very sad state if anti-anti monopoly lawsuits can hold any water .
LockeClone	cmp0mod	1418069812	. negative . i m just pointing out the ridiculousness of being against something that is overwhelmingly good because of a hypothetical negative . for the sake of argument the occasional leaked naked video or whatever vs the hundreds of lives that might be saved and thousands of lives that might escape jail and all the ruination that goes with it is and easy cost to justify . not to mention the bad cops that will be kept more honest and the good cops that will be protected . and cops are walking government surveillance platforms already . now they will be more honest government surveillance platforms .
LockeClone	cl2xsjw	1412700186	. i do n't agree with all your points but you seem like a reasonable fellow . when it comes down to it i ll push for a minimum wage increase until i actually see a negative impact on the economy . i know too many people who would see an instant and profound impact on their lives macro economy be damned . i also subscribe to the ideology that pegging minimum wage to the cost of inelastic goods represents a moral boon because working for less money than it takes to participate in society makes you a slave .
LockeClone	cl2x6sg	1412699090	. i ve practically had my ear talked off by cops before when i was told we need to search your car . i informed him that i do not consent to a search at least twenty times before i was allowed to go . years later i was stopped on the street i do n't know why and told i needed to produce an id . i said do you suspect me of a crime . he said no i said i do n't consent to that . am i being detained . he said no i said i d like to go please . i m heavily paraphrasing but if this lady felt uncomfortable and she knew her rights she could have asked to leave after receiving the warning and he would have had to let her leave . if he would have said you ca n't and then proceeded to preach to her then we re treading on establishment clause territory . basically she was not being detained even if she felt she was . if you do n't allow this tactic then you dramatically change the national landscape for law enforcement . personally i think law enforcement could use a dramatic change but that s not the current law of the land .

LockeClone	cmjwobt	1417617431	. yes but do n't be myopic about it . raising the minimum wage to a reasonable level cascades upwards because it increases the demand for labor by eliminating the need for minimum wage workers to hustle multiple jobs . those jobs still need doing so the employers will have to fill them . if those help wanted signs stay up too long because the demand for labor is too high then they ll have to raise the offered pay to something more competitive than minimum . and when minimum wage nips at the heels of a higher tier of work those employees will expect to be compensated better . at a more reasonable minimum wage everybody but a few caligula-rich people win . now i m not saying a higher minimum wage is always good . if it gets too high if wages in general get too high gdp can take a hit and we all lose but america is n't anywhere close to this threshold and has n't been since about 1973 . we re on the opposite end of the spectrum where we risk collapsing gdp because of stagnant capitol velocity due to wage suppression . and before you cite costs rising directly correlated to wages i d like you to find a historical example of this . the do n't exist inside the us and outside they only exist within extreme economic environments like post wwi germany . a sudden doubling of our current minimum wage would be a drop in the bucket compared to their policies . also wages as a business expense take up different percentages of different industries . some items would cost more while other items would remain unchanged . two key areas that are unaffected by minimum wages are healthcare and housing and what are the two areas that are killing the middle class right now . healthcare and housing . so even if the price of food would rise directly proportionate with minimum wage which it most certainly would not and has not in the past it s still a win for the vast majority of americans . i get bent at people saying that certain jobs just are n't worth a reasonable standard of living because i think the notion of any job not being worth a ticket to interacting with society in a meaningful way is insulting and destructive . it hurts the economy it hurts real people it insults the modern human condition and it frankly stupid because it does n't need to happen except for classism inherent in so many american mindsets .
LockeClone	cf0zp5b	1390926688	. ugh . so federal employees are traditionally supposed to make less than their private sector counterparts . however while federal jobs have done a better job staying unionized and keeping wages better tied to inflation the private sector has gone to shit . public sector wages have suffered too but not to the extent the private sector has . my point is that public sector wages more closely represent where wages and benefits should be or where we should expect them to be . i think the president recognizes this and is attempting to protect the public s weining expectation for decent wages . i personally believe that this is a losing battle and more drastic and all-encompassing wage reforms are necessary .
LockeClone	ckr2obt	1411547556	. gt according to your logic no business that does n't involve heavy government regulation is moral unless all of the employees are millionaires . did you pull this out of tin air or am talk radio . gt you part about the average uber employee is pathetic . do you honestly think you can just make up things like that and expect to win your argument . i ve worked for both lyft and uber in the la area and know plenty of other people who have and currently do . you can make 20/hr during peak hours which equates to about 15.25 after gas and w amp t during normal hours monday-thursday and weekends during the day i usually made between 10 15/hr . add gas and w amp t and you dip below minimum . i once had a four hour stint with two tiny fares and made about 12 the entire time . gt prove it . show us their employee marketing plan and data on current employees . for some reason after reading your post i expect it to be written in crayon . first of all do n't be a dick . your dickishness changed this from a conversation to an argument and i doubt you ll even read this far into my post . second i m not an executive at these companies so sadly i do n't have charts and graphs to show you . i can tell you that the per/mile fees changed almost weekly especially with lyft . they re young and competitive and do n't know where the line is yet . the problem with them dialing in a competitive number with uber is that the race to the bottom harms drivers . furthermore if these businesses make taxi services obsolete then we ve just axed tens of thousands of jobs that pay pretty well in exchange for a couple thousand jobs that pay much worse . if this was just happening in the transportation world we could say it s just the times but it s happening rapidly in almost every labor sector of the economy . the result is a hollowing out of wages followed by wealth for the vast majority of americans . regardless of how talking heads feel about how things aughtta be run i do n't think many of us want to live in an america where the only jobs available for our children are service-industry slogs that pay little and pile all liability onto the laborers .

Snarfthedstroyer	choo1f6	1400788919	. i agree with most of that my point was more to highlight an often overlooked function that the military serves . the only thing i would argue against is the move towards reserves and guard . those units are frequently undertrained and underprepared . relying more heavily on them while cutting active duty forces would result in a fighting force that would take heavier casualties and ultimately be more expensive should we have a war with large numbers of infantry on the front lines . i would instead propose keeping the high end operators seals pjs rangers etc at their current levels or increasing them slightly as they re the ones that do the heavy lifting on the ground . some of the non-combat jobs could be moved towards the reserves but i want my troops that are going to be in combat to have that as their main focus . i would love to see the excessive military spending and manpower not completely eliminated but reallocated to domestic services . instead of x amount of dollars for aircraft or tanks or ships that we do n't need move that money and the personnel into infrastructure improvements . take the excellent job training structure of the military and put those people directly into the civilian workforce . instead of supporting a redundant base in bumfuck texas or korea or guam or wherever we could have more americans going to work to make the entire country better through building projects .

Hot_Corner	ciqpxzf	1404749542	. r/politics we need to talk . i ve gone through the thread and captured a few comments that are more or less the norm around this sub . it is why it is colloquially referred to as a circlejerk and was removed as a default sub . despite the majority of this sub claiming that republicans are anti-science and do n't like statistics i ca n't tell you how many times i ve cited actual peer reviewed studies that do n't support the liberal agenda . only one person has admitted they need to do more research and thanked me for the links . now i m not saying everyone has to thank everyone for the links . the ones i use are not my research thank the authors . but more often than not i ve shown users the research and they go right back to posting shit about the minimum wage that is not supported by evidence all the while claiming it is republicans who are in denial . gt minimum wage the conservative stance on these issues has been categorically disproven actually it has not been disproven . believe it or not there is a world outside of r/politics . i ve not seen one study that addresses the actual claim of effects on employment . do not confuse this with increased unemployment . anyone in r/politics have one . here are a few links that show that despite this poster s claim it has not been categorically disproven . at average employment elasticities greater than 0.89 for all affected workers net benefits to poor workers are negative . . . when we allow for negative employment effects we find that the working poor face a disproportionate share of the job losses . . do you have any evidence other than faith in the invisible hand that anything you have said has any basis well researched peer reviewed papers by actual economists . and by economist i mean someone that actually studied the field of economics at an accredited school and are respected by their peers not some fringe idiot at some d.c think tank that calls themselves an economist because they ve managed to make a lot of money . this was not a reply to one of my posts but i thought more or less exemplified the attitude around here . why yes yes i do have actual peer reviewed studies that show a case against raising the minimum wage see above . do n't worry i do n't suspect this poster would do anything other than become non-responsive in the face of these studies . ironically the person who is not trained in economics but this poster did not bother to look into that at all and was perfectly willing to accept that claim that is the very definition of confirmation bias . to be fair someone did call this poster out and said they were embarrassed to be associated with them despite sharing the same viewpoint . i think we need more posters like that around here . gt the nutty thing i ve experienced debating these nutbags libertarians is they never ever respond to the data . they always pretend as if the data does n't exist and proceed to argue ideology . never statistics . that s funny becase as i ve already mentioned that is my exact problem with the liberals in here who are more interested in feeling self righteous and furthering their preconceived notions . gt when your belief system is challenged it s easier to kick and scream and stick your fingers in your ears than it is to adapt and accept that you were wrong unfortunately . yes it is as the poster above and r/politics has clearly shown . gt whites across the board have higher wages . some of it is the state fucking with people who are n't white more often or alternately giving whites special treatment by not fucking with them the state providing better services to white people better schools etc businesses giving preferential hiring treatment to whites businesses red-lining services and housing in non-white neighborhoods no grocery stores etc or whites hooking up other whites with jobs through their personal networks which naturally include better jobs . but when these practices are undermined through formal government action which disproportionately benefits people of color a lot of whites get all freaked out . this one was really interesting because it recognized the disparity between races . although i do n't suspect the poster is aware that the origins of the first minimum wage were used specifically to keep blacks out of the workforce . i also do n't suspect he s aware that minimum wage and raising the minimum wage results in higher black and youth unemployment . i m happy to explain the econonic reasons behind it if anyone is interested . here is a source which supports this . . could that be why whites have higher wages . if you compare black vs white and use people who have the same level of education same continuous cycle of employment that disparity vanishes and often times the black person is making more . i realize that digging through to the bottom of things is much more difficult than accepting everything at face value but if that s going to be our method of approach then lets not indoctrinate anyone else . gt its been proven that moderate increases in minimum wage over a period of time has little to no effect on employment . this is one of the exact posters i m talking about . i ve shown him/her more than once studies that show there is in fact an effect on employment . that effect may or may not be unemployment but as the studies i cited above show there is an effect . incidentally whenever i ve shown them to him/her no response . this mentality needs to change around here . if we re wrong . admit we re wrong . if someone shows us an academically cited paper that could prove us to be wrong do more research before continuing on posting the same nonsensical claims like the one above . this is n't just relating to minimum wage . it happens in threads around here all the time . admittedly this one is just the straw that broke the camel s back .
Hot_Corner	cfx0zjj	1394228514	. the verdict is in and just because some people choose to ignore it does n't change anything . it s not really an oversimplification . they either hire based on price or they do n't and i promise you they do . the employer will compare the wage to the value that the employee brings in as long as the value is above minimum wage that employee will have a job . but every time you increase the minimum wage you alter the hiring behavior of employers . if you agree that employers hire based on price than you have to agree with that statement and i ve already told you they do hire based on price so where are you failing to understand this . more money in the pockets of the people who will spend it . meaning a transfer of resources correct . because i know you re not dumb enough to assume that an increased minimum wage will magically create more money . ok so when you say people who will spend it you re implying that currently it goes into the hands of people who do n't spend it . what do they do with it . edit to your edit fairness can not be discussed because you are saying action/result a is not fair which is entirely subjective therefore you must do action b to mitigate action a which you ve arbitrarily deemed unfair . fairness is all a matter of which lense you re viewing something through and telling everyone to look through your lense and forcing a solution based on your lense only is completely irrational . does that make sense .

Hot_Corner	cf39s28	1391136255	. i might be wrong so correct me if i am but you re probably someone who blindly rejects studies by the cato institute and the heritage foundation but politico passes your high level of standards . i mean please . i ve yet to see a study that strongly links pupil spending and performance so the fact that vouchers take money our of the public education system would be negligible on the performance of the public school . if you have a study i m happy to read it but the data seem to indicate otherwise . if you re the bookish type i d like to recommend inside american education by thomas sowell .

Hot_Corner	cf1ayyj	1390949422	. gt guys pay more car insurance until a certain age 25-32 because they are more likely to or perceived to get in more accidents . younger women pay more in health insurance because of the costs associated with reproductive health in particular prenatal care men pay more later because they generally have more health problems as they get older prostate high blood pressure etc . yes that all makes sense . in all those instances the person is more likely to file a claim under their insurance . that validates everything i said . gt 2 the higher premiums are highly disproportionate to the expected medical costs maybe i ve never seen read anything about that and i do n't know how the models they use to determine that work at that granular level . gt 3 just because they cover you does n't mean they cover that preexisting high blood pressure that you had been maintaining through sporadic checkups and medication well yeah . you have to make sure its covered . they will cover you for the right price for anything . so i m not really sure what that has to do with anything . my problem with the legislation is that democrats consistently champion the validity of forcing other people to live by their will but it s important to know and i have yet to see it happen that anyone can start an insurance company and insure whoever they want . so if president obama or bernie sanders or harry reid think its that important than that is my challenge to them . go out develop a better business model and insure those people to your heart s content . until then quit telling us everything that s wrong and making it more difficult to operate in that space . but that wo n't happen because while pre-existing condition patients certainly benefit from the aca and that s great . my heart truly goes out to those people . but they are not the primary beneficiaries . 70 of medical ailments are the result of choices . life is full of choices and if you choose to make poor choices that are going to increase your premiums than in my opinion you ca n't really sit here and complain how high your insurance premiums are .
Hot_Corner	cgzkuoq	1398220084	. gt i ll give you the benefit of the doubt and explain it since it does n't really bother me to do so . investopedia defines economic growth as an increase in the capacity of an economy to produce goods and services compared from one period of time to another . yes i know what it is . you ve created two scenarios 100 families vs 10 families and you re saying the income in one scenario has a greater capacity to expand the economy and i m saying they do not . we have no reason to believe two equal sums have two different capacities for economic growth . again i m not saying income growth but the capacity for both as both sums are the same is equal . gt why resort to personal attacks . i could be asking the same question no you could n't because i saw the shit argument you were making from a mile away and you ve yet to figure mine out .
Hot_Corner	cehaqn1	1388864565	. gt this is less of a hospital er burden than it is a business opportunity . you d think republicans would be all over a business opportunity . well the aca was sold to us based on the premise that it would be cheaper for taxpayers to provide long term relatively inexpensive care in a pcp rather than paying the er bills of the people who could n't afford to and would needlessly go there because they were denied pcp . but the study done clearly shows that providing more care increases er visits which will ultimately increase er costs and costs to the taxpayer . it has nothing to do with trying to spin this in to a business opportunity . to sum it up politicians lied . we should n't be too shocked there . we were lied to about keeping our plans and we re lied to about the cost saving mechanism of the aca . what will happen is that it wo n't work and the government will say see the free market just can not solve our healthcare problems . just give us control and we ll solve it . this has been my prediction from day one based on simple economics and a basic understanding of the business model of the insurance industry .
Hot_Corner	ck6jxrg	1409609032	. when you find people not represented evenly that does not show the institutional effect because almost no where in human affairs do you find people evenly represented . let s just imagine that the 30 of whites were ivy league educated would you be surprised that they re not stopped as much . no because statistics show that the more highly educated you are the less crime you re going to commit . so in that scenario it would n't be a black vs white issue it would be an educated vs non educated issue but the left has misinterpreted it as black vs white . do you see . you believe there are racial undertones because of a large disparity in arrests . are there any say racial undertones in golf . there is a large disparity in blacks sponsored by ping vs whites sponsored by ping right . you would then have to agree that there are racial undertones in who ping sponsors to play golf for them . but we know that s not true because that would not show the institutional effect because almost no where in human affairs do you find people evenly represented . do you see my point . in order to determine if blacks are truly targeted more you d have to compare a black person and a white person of similar levels of wealth and education . the point is to isolate one variable race and see if it plays a factor . do n't compare a high school dropout in harlem to a harvard educated doctor and then say well this must be racism . you have n't isolated the variable you wish to build your conclusion around . finally the discussion was about whether race played a part in the michael brown shooting . not whether race plays a part in the entire town . but i believe i ve dismantled both arguments .

Hot_Corner	cfoobco	1393368513	. i decided to do my own 20 seconds of googling because your source was a study on new zealand and i do n't know anything about their education system . additionally you misquoted your source . it says teachers worked on average 43 hours per week . what i found was a study done for the bls on us teachers and found they work less . . if you do n't like the pay as with any other job you re free to leave and go somewhere you deem more deserving . but do n't hold the children hostage while preventing scrubs from coming in . people who go into teaching understand teacher salaries prior to becoming a teacher . it is not a mystery . if you understand that and still decide you want to be a teacher great . but do n't go into it and hold children hostage so you can line your own pockets . gt how the fuck does demanding more money for teaching more students encourage larger classes . imagine your budget is 100 for 10 teachers . now let s say 5 of them decide they want a 2 dollar raise or they re going on strike . well that 10 extra that they get is 10 less that could go to a new teacher which would decrease class size . i ca n't believe this even needs to be spelled out . gt is n't that true of everything . raising the cost of a burger 5 cents will increase the profits of the company by millions . sorry if i do n't understand your complex arguments but this does n't seem to apply . yes that s true and yes it still applies . if i decide that i m not happy with the 5 cent raise i will just simply choose not to eat the burger . you ca n't choose to not pay your property taxes . that s why i said this disincentive is a problem in public funding . you need to re-read what i wrote . there is no one forcing you to buy the burger . there are people forcing you to pay your taxes . i m not sure i understand the second part of that paragraph . teachers salaries are spread out across taxpayers . so 10 for me and 9 other people would be 1000 for the teacher . what am i missing . gt also true about the private sector . when employees get paid the customer is always footing the bill . it is the owners of the company who are paying you . they make a product that consumers in the market like otherwise they would n't be in business and you get paid out of their profits . if the customers do n't like the product they ll stop paying . we can not do this with teachers salary . i m quite certain a man in a black suit and curly cord behind his ear will come and throw me in a cage if i do n't pay my taxes i m exaggerating about who would be sent but the principle is the same . yes i know what sophistry means . that s why i said its baseword . you reading comprehension bro . i did n't take it as a compliment . i took it as you rushing to judgement because god forbid someone come into r/politics and disagree with leftist leg humping teachers . i did n't say i was smarter . though i do believe so after reading your second post . i said your argument is piss poor and it is . your argument was i know a few teachers teachers and they all work 60 hours per week . therefore i think teachers deserve to be paid more . and i still maintain that that is a piss poor argument .
Hot_Corner	cfzlt6k	1394511450	. cepr is a liberal think tank . would you accept sources from cato . did n't think so . that is hardly the gotcha you thought it would be . i prefer sources like this at average employment elasticities greater than 0.89 for all affected workers net benefits to poor workers are negative . . . when we allow for negative employment effects we find that the working poor face a disproportionate share of the job losses . .
Hot_Corner	ci91sox	1402940678	. ok then those people are wrong and we need to hold them accountable for blatantly disregarding evidence on both issues . so back to the whole comment that prompted this yes it was good to point out that obama believes in god which is just as if not more asinine than denying climate change . that being said he loses a lot of credibility by likening those republicans to thinking the moon is made of cheese when he himself believes there is a man in the sky . in my opinion someone who believes in religion and god is far worse and more detrimental to society than someone who denies climate change .

Hot_Corner	cexe1nf	1390530969	. the link you provided notes that eliminating donation to churches not a fair comparison but even if we do roll with that conservatives still give disproportionately more . what that means is that because liberals earn x more we would expect to see them give x more to charity but they are giving some number which is less than x even though x might be more than y the percentage that conservatives give . i do n't remember the s from the book . you might want to read it first .

Hammedatha	cfzz4jf	1394560444	. gt i would love to hear how stalinism leninism or socialism are not rooted in marxism especially considering i have actually read the communist manifesto and marx explains it all quite well . uh reread my post . i in fact said the very opposite of that . stalinism was based in marxism direct quote from the post right up there . rooted in does not equal identical to . leninism differed from marxism marx would have never advocated a country in russia s position turn to socialism they were barely out of feudalism . and you re utterly utterly wrong about what marx thought about communism . communism as marx defined it is more like utopian anarchy than a totalitarian state . communism meant a lack of class and a lack of state a lack of power really . how it turned out in practice was n't like that but then again no country marx would have considered ready for socialism ever had a socialist revolution . the closest things are the democratic socialist nations like sweden who are doing pretty well .
Hammedatha	ci9nvdc	1402992920	. uh every scientific body in the world at one point accepted one thing then did more research and now accept another thing . that s how science works . you would n't say oh so now you trust physicists when they say the universe is expanding but around 100 years ago they said the universe was stable .
Hammedatha	cg3gtif	1394917727	. the direct result being that the president enforces marijuana prohibition to the letter of the law and ends medical marijuana and legalized marijuana on the state level . that s the direct result of this bill . rand voted for it . you can try to disguise it with bullshit semantics like all libertarians do to avoid the consequences of their policy choices but that s the cold bare reality of it . i hope democrats spend a lot of money in the right circles spreading this around if he runs for president .
Hammedatha	cenuk2h	1389555856	. there exists no method to regulate a polygamy . really . that s your argument . okay . . . you pointed out cases where it could be complicated . i m saying it s complicated is a shit excuse to keep people from living the way they want . you say there is a history of abusive relationships i say again that has no bearing on what should be legal . punish the abusers not everyone at all similar to the abusers . of course the laws are not equipped to address the situation now . that should be changed . laws are not yet equipped to handle the internet but we did n't ban the internet until they sorted out the legal side . edit and i disagree that your example shows that polygamy harms anyone more than regular marriage . divorce currently means only a portion of the parents have access to the child most of the time . the same harm comes with polygamy . that the biological mother might not end up with the child is not more harmful to the mother or child than a mother losing custody to her husband after he has remarried . the difference is instead of living with his/her biological father and an unrelated woman new to him/her the child ends up with his/her biological father and two unrelated women he/she has known for his/her entire life . divorce is complicated and painful i do n't see how multiple partners makes it any more painful . potentially more complicated but we all ready expect courts to make very hard decisions about child welfare that are on the same level of difficulty in my opinion .
Hammedatha	cj3ruhg	1405976314	. you do . my father in law is in constant insane pain due to a deeply fucked up back . still ended up with a great enough degree of pain plus tolerance that he was hallucinating before they gave him an implant to mask the pain and lowered his dose . of course now the issue is they ca n't legally give him enough to make him not miserable and if he smokes pot they ll cut him off entirely in ky you must be drug tested monthly or once every two months to get pain pills pot is tested for and will cause you to be banned from pain clinics which are the only places that can give out heavy pain meds .
Hammedatha	cfg4jbt	1392492028	. there is mention of homosexuality in the new testament . paul iirc condemns it but it s somewhat unclear if he was condemning homosexuality as a whole or simply roman male prostitution . romans 1:26-27 i believe was the verse for this cause god gave them up unto vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet .
Hammedatha	cn3g0xl	1419358516	. why should possessive nouns exist if we have a perfectly good rule for turning a non possessive noun into a possessive noun . i s and you s would work just as well and make the language more consistent . sure we would have two words spelled the same but it would not be the first time that happened nor would it be unclear in the vast majority of situations . where clear language is really important you would never use a written contraction anyway .
Hammedatha	cf8a4dm	1391660588	. gt that is true and i agree for most drugs but should we sell a substance over the counter that basically turns people into monsters . there isnt really a safe form or dosage of meth . are you sure you just have n't bought into a stereotype about meth . there are functional meth heads people you d never know did meth . and it s a hell of a lot safer if you know how much you are taking and that there s nothing weird or even more poisonous mixed in . will some people turn into monsters on meth . sure . some people turn into monsters when they re drunk too . is there any safe amount of meth . probably not but there s not safe amount of tobacco smoke either . i do n't want meth legal because i want to do meth or because i want other people to do meth . i want meth and all other drugs to be legal because the alternative to legal meth is n't less meth it s just less safe and reliable meth . and the profits from the sales of that meth goes into the hands of criminals . my system would have hard drugs be legal but regulated such that basically only nonprofit organization could make and sell them and any potential profits from the organization go into the education system and healthcare . advertising would be illegal . at least advertising of drugs including alcohol and tobacco though i ve come to believe more and more that marketing is the root of many human problems . we have to accept after decades of trying to deny this and fight against it that people will always do drugs . no matter how educated no matter how informed or even brainwashed and lied to about the dangers of drugs people will use them . forcing their sale underground does nothing but exacerbate the problem . better to tax it and make it inconvenient and put social pressure on people to stop . basically treat every drug like we do cigarettes .
Hammedatha	cfe2u86	1392265438	. effective sure but arduous or avoidable . how do you calculate wealth . the classic example of the problem is someone who inherits something valuable like an old family house or a farm or a piece of art . do you tax them based on its value . that could force them to sell it if they are otherwise poor and if they want to keep it for sentimental reasons it hardly is making them rich . so you do n't tax until they turn it into money right . but then rich people turn their money into such objects to avoid being taxed .
Hammedatha	cf290q3	1391040553	. yes normals . as in within a certain arbitrary distance from average on measurable qualities . mentally retarded persons are abnormal . i m abnormal because i have a mental illness . the only reason you d find this insulting is if you find the idea of being abnormal wrong .
Hammedatha	cezmy5b	1390782220	. because the relationship between employer and employee is inherently unbalanced . what the employee risks by holding out alone is far more than the employer risks . only if employees act collectively can they threaten the employers livelihood to the same degree the employer can threaten theirs . you also are ignoring how closed shops arise agreementa between management and labor .
Hammedatha	cf9ucmw	1391821110	. unfortunately he s got a bad mix of libertarian economic policy i think i d vote for someone who referred to themselves as a fascist before i d vote for someone who honestly believes in libertarian economic policies and pandering to the lowest common denominator of right wing low information voters . privacy rights are the only thing he s even semi good on . and privacy rights are n't everything despite what you hear on reddit .
Hammedatha	cfqlp6z	1393553248	. i do n't want to ban 99 of all guns and i m not the one playing word games here . the person i responded to took ban all guns to mean ban any guns when it clearly did not way more semantic fuckery there . if you want to know my opinion gun control is a politically dead issue and can only harm politicians i otherwise agree with . i own guns and am friends with many who own guns and would not want to see any of them have their guns taken away though i d be willing to give mine up for the proper legislation . if i were king of the world i d ban handguns and full autos and let people have what they want of the rest with similar restrictions on shortening the barrels but since i m not king of the world that hardly matters .
Hammedatha	cg748ba	1395286249	. he did n't say stupid he said hillbilly . which means rural and usually undereducated not the same thing as stupid . does that not describe a people who are heavily republican . i m from kentucky i ve met a variety of hillbillies in my time and most have indeed been socially conservative and if they did n't support republicans it was because the republicans were too liberal . or they were hung up on their whole party of lincoln thing which does n't make a great deal of sense for kentuckians but what can you do . i ve met a few liberal hill billies usually young drug dealers or users but they are a minority .
Hammedatha	cg0io2h	1394604470	. that would make her more likely not to speak out against the cia . i think this is what it seems to be a pissing match between the senate intelligence committee and the cia . the nsa she defended because they were doing what she wanted . sure maybe they lied to congress a few times but it was all in aid of allowing congress to support their spying without appearing to . but this this is the cia directly challenging her committees power and that she will not put up with . she s an amoral power hungry politician she s not an idiot or a witch .
Hammedatha	cgo6i5y	1397062502	. which is fucking insane but some people believe it strongly none the less . i can not fathom why people generally accept crime prevention and investigation disaster prevention and recovery etc are perfectly valid roles for government but healthcare is not . your house catches on fire and the government will help you . you catch pneumonia and you have to go to the private sector for any assistance .
Hammedatha	cj3ymxe	1405989566	. i do n't think so in that case . i believe it s only for people with chronic pain problems . here s the deal to get regular prescriptions for strong painkillers in ky as i understand it you need to go through a specialized pain clinic . these clinics drug test you every visit . there are some good reasons for this avoiding bad drug interactions and such . but if you have an illegal drug in your system or something you were n't prescribed you re out . ky has a huge prescription drug abuse problem and there are tons of restrictions of who can prescribe what painkillers and when so being out pretty much means you re fucked . maybe you can go to a different pain clinic i do n't know . there s been a lot of recent well over the last decade regulation about who can prescribe painkillers and when they can and how much they can . as usual this has had some good results crooked doctors have a harder time and some bad ones good doctors unable to do what they think is best for their patients . i m obviously somewhat biased hearing about this mainly through my father in law who is understandably upset that he has to be in more pain than is strictly necessary for him .
Hammedatha	cexg52x	1390535656	. if you follow the logic that a woman should have a say over her body you re pro choice anyway . if you follow the logic that a fetus is the equivalent of a person then a child of rape is no more worthy of death than the child of a drunken one night stand .
Hammedatha	cn5zv9y	1419625639	. i mean laffer was n't entirely wrong . it s true that if you crank taxes extremely high revenues will drop because more people will get paid under the table out of necessity . the faulty assumption the right has always made was that they assumed we were on the far side of the laffer curve with no evidence for that .
Hammedatha	cf2eh0o	1391052504	. left . we do n't have a left anymore . obama is implementing ideas his critics and would be opponents supported in recent history . romney supported the exact same policies that make up obamacare huckabee supported requiring insurance to cover birth control in his state . obama is in terms of policy foreign and domestic a moderate republican from 10-20 years ago . the republicans have dragged everyone rightward . so in a way even if they never win another national election they won . the democrats are now fighting tooth and nail for things they thought were unacceptable in the 90s .
Hammedatha	cjr8d0x	1408128147	. and if you and people like you are in the minority why should n't schools do that . also imo if you learn well from lecture you ll learn well from what lectures get replaced with likely lectures with interactive elements like clicker questions which will be only marginly less shitty than lecture anyway . i had the same thing in school . i wanted reading assignments tests and worksheets . schools i went to emphasized visual learning and physical interaction with objects . i was a non-visual learner i did way better with numbers on paper than beads on a string . i also preferred classes to be bog standard lecture read test in college but that s just so i could skip the lectures and just read before the test . as a teacher i ve found that kids who lecture works for will learn the material no matter what . they do n't really need the teacher at all maybe a few questions over a semester but basically they could get by with a very occasional tutor and a textbook . kids who lecture does not work for usually can not learn the material on their own either .
Hammedatha	cfa1vyl	1391844217	. so you d rather more children be born unwanted . cause that s what being against abortion really means . more unwanted kids . you d be for higher taxes to take care of them yes . higher educational standards and a much more robust foster care system otherwise you re certainly going to have more crime . better murdered than born unwanted imo .
Hammedatha	cf7cgfa	1391570277	. but someone else working when you do n't need to where you would n't need to anywhere else in the western world btw is goo.d . we need fucking jobs and you re mad some taxes will go to folks who can handle every other expense instead of someone else who might really need a job .
Hammedatha	cevssun	1390375049	. the stagnation of wages is a major reason why the economy sucks . we ve just barely pulled away from the death spiral and could head back in an instant . if we do n't earn we can not consume if we can not consume things stop working .
Hammedatha	cg0u7bi	1394645363	. condoms are not always effective . i ve been married for 3 years birth control pretty literally drives my wife insane we used condoms but eventually we will probably get unlucky . at that point we will have an abortion no matter the cost but it would be great if it was covered by insurance . edit actually my personal situation is besides the point . the fact remains that some people will not use birth control or have sex responsibly some people will always get pregnant without intending it or being able to deal with the consequences and society as a whole suffers if we force them to bring children into the world that they do not have the desire or ability to care for and raise . a great deal of conservative positions seem to rely on the idea that if we just tell people to behave responsibly and make the consequences for not being responsible very grave that people will just behave responsibly but all of history indicates that s not the case . we have to deal with the fact that people will never be perfect they will never make perfect decisions . we have to allow for a way out for those who have made mistakes because otherwise we all suffer from having a segment of society that is desperate and sees no way out .
Hammedatha	cewaf3b	1390428571	. moderate increase and improved enforcement of a progressive income tax and massive decrease in defense spending should cover it . but really it would require a massive paradigm shift in culture which will eventually need to happen if automation continues to become more prominent . that or massive numbers of people will need to die . one or the other .
Hammedatha	cex86c5	1390518151	. hmmm if only there were some system where elections could be funded from a general pool of money drawn from the general public so that the candidates would not need or want to sell themselves to moneyed interest . public funding of elections if you will . alas for this to work you would have to make all privately funded political commercials illegal which is unconstitutional .
Hammedatha	censel7	1389551142	. why . why is two men okay but one man and two women or three men and two women wrong . imo its hard to regulate should not be an excuse to limited rights . i m 100 behind this executive order and a big supporter of gay marriage but i also recognize there is really no more reason to ban polygamy/andry and first cousin marriage than there is to ban gay marriage . some people find it yucky is basically the only excuse . are there abusive polygamist and incestuous relationships . sure . are there abusive gay and monogamist straight relationships . absolutely . no reason to ban any of them . btw first cousins producing children are not more likely to produce offspring with genetic problems than two random people unless the cousins were themselves the product of incest . it s only over the course of several generations that it becomes genetically pragmatic . an issue when most people could not leave their home town not any more .

Hammedatha	cfzoqbs	1394523134	. you do n't just pay x and buy an election . you buy commercials you buy name recognition you buy the media but ultimately that only affects the elections if voters believe it . it s not like no one vote for him the majority of voters did . it s horrible that we allow money into our elections to such a degree but it s even worse that what this money buys genuinely influences people .
Hammedatha	cgyzay6	1398175838	. illegal would be extreme and pointless . a tax on junk food just as we tax alcohol and cigarettes would be more sensible . imo its insane we tax cigarettes and not junk food and soda . i say this as someone who drinks smokes and eats junk food . health care should be as much a domain of government as policing and we should tax both income and unhealthy behavior to fund it . i fail to see how this would do anything but better the nation . employers would be spared the great cost of healthcare which is what drives them to only use part time workers unless absolutely necessary . it would mean employees actually had a more equitable bargaining positions with employers knowing that they and their family would be taken care of if sick regardless of their employment . of course this is why powerful business interests are against it .

Hammedatha	cgic63a	1396463600	. utilities are government enforced monopolies most everywhere . that s what a utility is . should it be publically owned rather than a private concern that accepts monopoly with the strings of intense regulation . probably . but it makes no sense to have multiple power companies competing with multiple grids .
Hammedatha	cf992ot	1391758760	. and there s no good reason lsd is illegal . hell there s no good reason for any drug to be illegal prohibition does nothing but give criminals money and make drugs more unreliable and dangerous to users but there s especially no reason for the common hallucinogens to be illegal .

Hammedatha	ckm3qkw	1411071312	. i d say everyone would benefit if that was the case . no one should starve or be exposed to the elements period . we are n't exactly drowning is jobs so it does n't really make sense for our society to incentivize work as much as we do .
Hammedatha	clpuf03	1414828424	. okay but can you not see that is inevitable . the only way to avoid it is to completely separate money from political power . which you ca n't . which was marx s whole point really . he may not have had the best solution but he diagnosed the problems of capitalism very well .
Hammedatha	cg9e3ji	1395532458	. yeah and i d still agree it was a stupid thing to say . we have no business in this conflict with russia no more than they did with us when we invaded iraq under false pretenses . ukraine is not a member of nato we have no obligation to defend their territorial integrity . this is russia and europe s business not america s .
Hammedatha	cfjsisj	1392863341	. so look into the science behind it . do some googling . iirc the general findings are that pot does impair driving but a not as much as alcohol and b not a significant amount in habitual users . anecdotally i can tell you it varies a lot person to person . i m a shitty driver and stoned i m a shitty driver who goes slowly . i do n't like driving stoned i find driving a stressful experience and being stoned makes it moreso . my wife is a good driver and she can be stoned out of her mind and still drive far better than i can sober after a good nights sleep . i actually prefer her to be stoned when i m riding with her a long distance because it keeps her speed down .
Hammedatha	cflz1gq	1393096610	. this is somewhat misleading . we are n't pumping those chemicals directly into our water supply . if everything goes as planned they wo n't end up anywhere near the water supply they end up separated from the water supply by an impermeable layer of rock . but the if everything goes as planned is the rub there because it will inevitably not in some cases .
Hammedatha	cfu3jf2	1393944970	. why . ip law has nothing to do with net neutrality . not everyone s opinion is going to line up 100 against or 100 with reddit . franken has always iirc supported net neutrality but as he worked in tv and probably has a lot of friends in the entertainment industry its to be expected he supports stuff like sopa and pipa .
Hammedatha	cfz4ht3	1394474892	. the problem with all posts like this is the it used to be better x years ago part . no . the rhetoric was different but the policy the goals the underlying ideology that was all just as awful going back to reagan . and before reagan you had nixons cronies who were n't much better and who later became ws cronies . the republicans have been a gold glossed turd of a political party for decades and what you re seeing now is n't the party changing its the gold flaking off . what good republican ideas did you support when reagan was president . what made you a republican in the first place . because as often as i see the republicans used to be better and have real ideas posted looking back i do n't see it until at least nixon . he had some genuinely good ideas wrapped up in his unfortunately paranoid mind . then you get to eisenhower whose policies would be too liberal to get nomimated as a democrat today . so what were these good republican ideas 10 to 15 years ago what were these good policies they stood for .
Hammedatha	ceolf2w	1389637758	. he s saying if the coal industry paid properly both for the dangerous and difficult work of miners and for the vast environmental damage and pollution costs down the line wv would be a utopia . instead its sucking up profits and leaving the costs to be paid by future generations who have to deal with the environmental damage in the state when it is no longer resource rich .
Hammedatha	cf9rpkc	1391814338	. the gop panders to libertarians it pushes almost no libertarian policy beyond deregulation of business . there are drug warrior democrats and republicans but the vast majority of legalization advocates who a . elected officials and b . members of one of the two majors parties are democrats . i d bet the majority of elected dems are against legalization but a larger majority of elected republicans are against it . it s all a matter of proportions .
Hammedatha	cg8jo91	1395433663	. that s exactly what i would conclude you think having your house covered in rat poison is worse than having rats . what you are both missing out on is that these are not 0 or 100 proposals . catholics could reasonably believe abortion is worse than birth control yet still oppose mandatory use of birth control for all people . they can not believe abortion is worse than birth control and oppose the possibility of access to birth control for those who want it . you can believe rats are worse than rat poison but not want to cover every surface of your house with rat poison . but if you refuse to use any rat poison at all i think you clearly view rat poison as worse than rats .
Hammedatha	cexgc5k	1390536104	. gt you sound like you would prefer the second mindset to the first . there s a difference between being a partner in consensual sex and being raped . i do . i m pro abortion not pro choice i actively wish for an increase in the number of abortions but i respect the logically consistent pro lifers those that believe in no exceptions except maybe in case the life of the mother is threatened . gt this is very crafty of you . there are people who feel that women who have been victims of a crime should be allowed to terminate an unwanted pregnancy that was forced on them . this is compassion . this is not slut-shaming . if they believe that the fetus is a person how could they ever possibly condone killing that fetus because of a crime committed by the father . that s not compassion it s a logical inconsistency that reveals their true opinion anti-sex not anti-abortion . gt that s not about thinking premarital sex is evil that s about thinking that high schoolers are irresponsible . i really do n't think high schoolers should be having a lot of sex . nor has any generation thought their kids should be having a lot of sex as teenagers . guess what . never made a difference . gt in my opinion just handing out condoms to everyone is akin to saying go ahead everyone s doing it . everyone basically i did n't but only due to shyness and lack of opportunity is doing it . all ready . the only difference is they could be doing it safer . gt also condoms do n't prevent herpes and herpes is forever . sex with condoms is n't perfectly safe but it s a lot safer than sex without .
Hammedatha	ceq8sbf	1389805976	. they truly believe that doesnt happen . these people have deeply fallacious logic like most conservatives . they believe in a just god and just world if a single mom was truly good and truly wanted to help her child she would be able to find the means . they have tied this in with free market fundamentalism so not only is god just he is the invisible hand of the free market . the only reasons people go without is that they are sinful and deserve it or because man read government has interferred . it is a potent combination of religious and economic ideology with no basis in reality . and its a part of even well educated intelligent non religious conservatives world views . they may not talk about abortion or say the word god but they have a deep belief that if you work hard you will succeed and if you have not succeeded you have not worked hard . it is a pathological meme ran rampant in our society . personal responsibility has never worked as a basis for running a society and it never will .
Hammedatha	ceosapo	1389652550	. there are many types of satanists . the most common are i believe members of levay s church of satan . they are atheists who are philosophically quite similar to ayn rand though more hedonistic . they have weird rituals but recognize them as ritual for rituals sake . they are called satanist half to troll christians and half to accurately describe their position as opposed to all things christianity promotes . satan being derived from a word for enemy or opponent . some satanists like the ones who put up the statue believe in and worship a mythological figure like the christian satan .
Hammedatha	cg4fjnk	1395021905	. i hope so that would make much more sense and be much cheaper and more efficient for basically everybody . obamacare is a really shitty compromise between collectivism and individualism like a great many pieces of awful policy in this country like student loans it s just slightly less shitty than the previous shitty compromise between collectivism and individualism we had .
citation_included	cm6fnpy	1416352259	. in irv voting for your honest favorite can cause your least favorite to win favorite betrayal . showing up and voting honestly can be worse for you than not voting at all participation . the best strategy in irv is to top vote the lesser of two evils naive exaggeration . as a result i would argue irv does n't do any better job letting you vote a 1 than approval in which its always safe to maximally support your honest favorite . the worst outcome of casting an approval ballot is you cause someone you approved of to win or someone you did n't approve of to lose .
citation_included	ck8fdpo	1409783562	. gt i would rather see proportional representation that makes legislative bodies reflect the people they represent proportional representation pr . it is limited in that senators can not be elected using pr constitution requires 1 elected at a time from each state and house members can only be be elected proportionally from a single state required to represent a state not the whole country . states are free to decide how their representatives are elected . unfortunately this federal law . the good news is that state governments are not similarly limited they have complete control over the design of their own legislature . they could for instance enact mixed member proportional representation mmp . again this can be done in many states via ballot initiatives .

Matthew37	cf0lij4	1390876404	. i m not going to refute them . other people have done that esp to many of her other opinion pieces and anyone who knows how to use google can find them pretty easily . basically she claims that the number of rapes is not much more than is reported despite her admission that some are not . using historical figures from various law enforcement agencies over time it s been determined that only 3 or 4 in every 10 or 12 i forget which rapes is ever reported and i suspect the cdc in their reports which i have n't read but i have read many other cdc reports explains in great detail the methodology they used to arrive at their figures . why do n't you download the report and read the methodology if you think you can do that in an unbiased fashion i doubt you can since you re a guy who clearly has issues with rape anyway .

Matthew37	cfbpc3q	1392044957	. i do n't know why people get surprised over this kind of thing . if you go to work for a catholic school you should n't be surprised if you are sanctioned somehow for violating one of the church s tenets regardless of how ludicrous society as a whole thinks it is .
Matthew37	cfc494b	1392077237	. gt claiming allegiance to your particular flavour of invisible man in the sky belief does not give you a right to discriminate . the courts have said it does . and almost all other developed countries do n't have a clause in their constitutions that prohibit the government from interfering with religious practices either .
Matthew37	cfbx4vr	1392062324	. well you can verify any of it by using the google machine . the democrats in congress have tried to pass the employment non-discrimination act enda which would prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity but of course the small government except when it comes to a woman s uterus or everyone s sex lives republicans are preventing it from passing .
Matthew37	cil1pg5	1404155142	. gt yeah but the religious views of the organization have to be genuine meaning they need to be written into the core mission of the organization and devoutly and honestly followed by it s owners . this applies to both the prohibition of receiving blood transfusions for jehovah s witnesses and there are some who oppose vaccinations on religious grounds . yet the scotus said this did n't apply to them . the prohibition of blood transfusions in the jw community is long-standing and well known . how is it logically consistent to allow those who object to contraception coverage to opt out but not those who oppose blood transfusions . why should a company run by jws be forced to pay for coverage of blood transfusions when a company run by christians not be forced to pay for contraceptive coverage . explain from your viewpoint .
Matthew37	ciyclcy	1405456118	. there s no way the house will pass this as long as there is a republican majority . edit of course that s the whole purpose to get the gop on the record as being in favor of this so they can continue to show that the gop is anti-woman .
Matthew37	cew2xfi	1390413638	. well now you need to go out and have some really weird sex and not have to worry about being arrested for it . lol there are still laws against adultery in many places but it s extremely rare for anyone to be charged with those . i have to wonder if the courts would find those too intrusive as well or more of a civil matter than a criminal one .
Matthew37	chwjsb7	1401649329	. gt nobody in a position to do so has said he would n't get one . you must be new to this . every trial that involves national security secrets or the like is a closed trial with severe restrictions on what the defendant can introduce as evidence . the federal government can simply state that a particular piece of evidence if admitted into the trial would compromise national security and/or sources etc and it s automatically kept from the trial . there s no legitimate appeal of that . he would not get anything approaching a real trial .
Matthew37	cfc2nyh	1392073647	. gt i think it would be interesting if all teachers who did n't actually want to abide by the roman catholic church s moral code refused to teach at a catholic school agreed . since we know that some 97 of women use some form of contraception at some point in their lives a huge majority of women who belong to the church do n't abide by their silly doctrine anyway . you have to wonder if those employment contracts have anything to say about the use of contraception . personally if i was asked to sign any kind of agreement that restricted what i did in my personal life i d tell the employer to fuck right off with the exception of activity related to a security clearance .
Matthew37	cimkd31	1404305916	. i think for the person of average intelligence such a statement is so incredibly outlandish as to not need to be countered . i m not going to debate this with you . as a male you have absolutely no say in whether a woman gets an abortion or has access to abortion services unless she chooses to involve you in it . your opinions and those of the drama queen asshat who wrote the piece about abortion mean exactly dick chief . endofstory .
Matthew37	cevusko	1390386358	. there s an age requirement for buying booze and cigarettes that has to be proven each time you buy them . with voting you prove age at registration and after that you just have to prove identity . i d have thought it did n't take a rocket scientist to figure that out .
Matthew37	cfbsr08	1392053429	. yeah that s another great example . byu is a private entity and as such they re perfectly free to restrict what the students and employees do so long as it relates to their religious mission . same is true with liberty university bob jones university which used to ban even hand holding on campus not sure if they still do or not oral roberts university and so forth . those are all religiously-affiliated organizations and have the same rights to restrict employee and student behavior as the church does .

Matthew37	cexe266	1390530996	. gt there is no rhetorical or mental gymnastics you can do to make women vote for you . i am beginning to wonder if they just have n't accepted that fact and do n't much give a shit how what they say is going to go over any more public pronouncements by the rnc notwithstanding and therefore blather on . they know it will play well with their fundamentalist and christian voters so they keep talking this stupid shit .
Matthew37	cht0x5a	1401277060	. gt and vote . is that supposed to be a joke . have you actually seen the slate of candidates that have been popping up in elections over the past generation or so . the idiocy is beginning to infect even the base local levels now too . when you get to the point where you have to decide which is the lesser of the two or more evils when you vote the concept of voting to improve society has pretty much lost its meaning .

Matthew37	chac8v2	1399321458	. gt the argument for the death penalty which i m against is n't retribution . it s they pose too great a risk to be allowed to live clearly you do n't understand the concept of the death penalty . it has nothing to do with eliminating risk though that may certainly be a side benefit . it is and always has been a retributative act just punishment for the wrong committed by the individual as determined by a jury of his/her peers . i am generally against the death penalty . however when someone commits certain types of crimes i.e the especially heinous killing of someone else as was done in this case or the killing of a police officer then i believe you forfeit your right to live in amongst the rest of society including those other criminals who are locked up .
Matthew37	ceewa69	1388604389	. all true . but the root issue is the way they are being used not that they are being used or being implemented . most jurisdictions can justify having a tactically trained team but they certainly do n't need to be deployed to every single search and warrant service . using those kinds of situations as training for tactical teams is fraught with the potential for abuse which you pointed out .
Matthew37	cirq8iu	1404839863	. your request for me to explain the difference contradicts your assertion that your english is pretty good . having a wrong and/or misinformed opinion is not the same thing as having an invalid opinion . what part of that is so hard to understand . i know you re trying to bend my statement to fit your agenda but i m not going to let you do that . the difference between what i said and what you ve interpreted me as saying supposedly is as clear as night and day to anyone who understands the basic definitions of the words being used . now run along and go back to your english 101 class like a good little boy .
Matthew37	cfc5cvo	1392079744	. that s exactly how they re designed to operate . there s a concept known as the three branches of government . ever heard of it . they re a co-equal arbiter of laws passed by congress and implemented by the executive branch . they by design have the final say on what is or is not constitutional . the fact that you disagree with it does not make their judgment incorrect or wrong per se . with respect to this situation they found that the government had no right to tell religious institutions how to implement their hiring practices to include the hiring and firing of employees . religious institutions are better positioned to determine what kinds of qualifications their employees ought to have vs the government having a hand in it .
Matthew37	cjazj6l	1406642946	. wow . what in the world has happened to free speech in this country . i hope they appeal this to the full appellate court and/or the scotus . i ca n't believe this would stand at the scotus though these days who d be surprised if it did .

Matthew37	ceetgdi	1388596638	. gt i think regular police as paramilitary forces is obsolete and creepy i can see why someone might think that way but when you consider how a police force works and has to work in order to be effective it makes sense that the military model is used same with fire services though not quite as rigid perhaps as that of a police force .
Matthew37	chtdzjh	1401307361	. gt it s about money this is so much more true than most people realize . police departments of all sizes get money and equipment from the federal government for anti-drug operations . the more drug interdiction you do the more money you get . they way you prove how much you re doing is by compiling arrest and clearance statistics . nypd loves the federal money so they have no incentive to stop doing small time weed busts . this is why you see small town/county police departments on interstates doing drug interdiction in many states too .
Matthew37	cepz6pq	1389767703	. i have never really though he had any chance at becoming the next president anyway . there are too many videos of him being an ass he s got no cred with the religious right which is sadly necessary for a republican presidential candidate these days and he s not ideologically aligned to the right enough to pass through the vetting process of today s right wingers . if we could somehow get many more people into the middle to vote in the middle he might have a chance . but i do n't see that happening any time soon .
IBiteYou	ci7wdd9	1402807941	. nixon did n't do it . nixon had an article of impeachment against him for trying to do it . bush did not do it . a both sides do it argument is not applicable here and is a fallacy . you guys care about what the nsa is doing under obama and so do i i do n't excuse it because it may have started under bush .
IBiteYou	ci7wnwr	1402808865	. i am not threatening you at all . i have not belittled anyone . you are the one who did that when you called me a fool though it appears now that you have edited your post . if you have a problem with me report me to the mods .
IBiteYou	chxfwxx	1401739466	. i think in many ways ron johnson is absolutely right about the tea party and its nature . it got its genesis when bush proposed tarp . people were already pissed off at bush spending and saw the move as bailing out some people while mom and pop s brake shop which was also suffering in the economy got no government help . so people coalesced around that . when obama was elected and the talk turned to stimulus it galvanized people who were already pissed at government spending . because not only was obama talking about spending but also democrats were complaining about the bush tax cuts . so people got pissed off and started to gather together and protest . there was no real organization to the groups although some merged some formed themselves and occasionally some puffed up banty rooster of a guy would be a tea party of one . i think that s what frustrated many . they really could n't put their finger on any central organization for the tea party . but people started showing up at townhalls and asking the hard questions . so what we saw was politicians fretting and saying these were just racists . or that these were stupid people . or some politicians said these folks were unamerican . there was also the constant drumbeat that somehow whispering these people were dangerous radicals who want violence . none of the fears materialized but the tea party was successful in getting out the vote and turning the congress red . in short the tea party is still there you will see them when they are sufficiently charged around a particular issue/s and it s time to get a message out . tea partiers are not ashamed to be in the tea party . they will never be ashamed to be in the tea party .
IBiteYou	cgqem3t	1397280072	. lol you have no refutation for this fact i presented regarding black democrat legislators so you went with sarcasm and ad hominem . i love it . it is the liberal way . here s the straight scoop . there are blue states that have fewer early voting hours than certain red states but when a red state wants to modify something and they will still have more voting hours than some blue states liberals scream bloody murder . when you point out that blue state y has less voting hours than red state z and that red state z has absentee voting liberals ignore it and insist red state z is taking our freedoms . when you point out that blue state y has stricter id laws than red state z wants shut up . red state z wants your freedoms . this is about one thing getting out the vote . and there s plenty of time to do it . people will march obliviously to the polls to vote democrat because no republican is going to take away their vote .
IBiteYou	ceo2mi3	1389573915	. gt we must also face up to the fact that the latter example has become a standard and frequently used conservative tactic in fairness occasionally a liberal one frequently a liberal one too . i just do n't want to see random citizens from either side penalized by an unspecific law . gt as far as your examples go republicans want people to die is fair comment and that s where you lost it . gt and grayson s comment although somewhat hyperbolic certainly contains elements of truth stalin would be proud .
IBiteYou	cf2y4ef	1391112042	. so did people read the entire story because there s only one-side of it presented here which is kind of ironic since they are accusing starnes of reporting one side of the story . the school has said we did n't do that after publicity but the parents have not commented .

IBiteYou	cgqem3t	1397280072	. lol you have no refutation for this fact i presented regarding black democrat legislators so you went with sarcasm and ad hominem . i love it . it is the liberal way . here s the straight scoop . there are blue states that have fewer early voting hours than certain red states but when a red state wants to modify something and they will still have more voting hours than some blue states liberals scream bloody murder . when you point out that blue state y has less voting hours than red state z and that red state z has absentee voting liberals ignore it and insist red state z is taking our freedoms . when you point out that blue state y has stricter id laws than red state z wants shut up . red state z wants your freedoms . this is about one thing getting out the vote . and there s plenty of time to do it . people will march obliviously to the polls to vote democrat because no republican is going to take away their vote .

IBiteYou	cga5fn1	1395619477	. you insisted the gop would impeach obama . i am saying they will not unless something drastic occurs that is undeniably grounds for impeachment . even if we were to discover that he personally ordered the irs to target people . i m not sure impeachment would fly because it would need 2/3 of the senate .

IBiteYou	cfeagmu	1392297871	. i m a she and bullying does n't necessarily mean physical force as you well know . i m a female conservative so i m very very familiar with liberal bullying having experienced it many times . it can be pressure to be something you are not and being insulted when you do n't go along with what the hivemind thinks is right . liberals can be very cruel to people who do n't conform when they believe those people should conform . i believe this is because it pops the bubble some liberals inhabit where they believe that they are the only possible party for x y or z people . think of it this way let s say for argument s sake that the democrats and republicans by and large do not favor gay marriage . but let s say the communist party does . the communist party is totally on board with gay rights now they also think that conservatives should go to re-education camps and they want to seize all wealth for the state but they are pro gay-rights . are gay folks obliged to support them . or are gay folks allowed to say thanks for the support but the rest of your platform is not appealing to me .
IBiteYou	centsx8	1389554240	. that s exactly the point . this article seems kind of non-specific but who exactly would be open to prosecution under such a law . as one of the commenters says just so ya ll understand the law . you could theorhetically be prosecuted and convicted for saying a republican candidate wants children to starve because he voted to reduce fod stamps . that is reckless disregard for the truth . granted some hard line liberals would argue the point but we all know that republicans do n't want kids starving they just disagree on how much is govt responsibility . if this same law were passed in a republican state democrats would be in an uproar . fortunately such an attack on free speech would never pass a republican controlled legislature . now there s a certain political site that frequently employs hyperbole/lies regarding the gop . would this mean that site x saying republicans want people to die . mean that site x can be prosecuted for saying such a thing . what about alan grayson who said the gop health care plan was die quickly even though he knew there was a gop alternative to the aca . would he face prosecution under such a law .

IBiteYou	cfinm8w	1392760440	. this is only a miniscule cut again after the spending increased by over 100 in five years . it is to be achieved by replacing the requirements that clinton ushered in . you democrats claim to want bipartisan consensus then you get a bipartisan bill and you say we want takesy backsies on this part of the bill k . that is called reneging on an agreement . reneging on an agreement that democrats voted for an agreement that obama signed into law . a bipartisan agreement . why should republicans agree to compromise or come to a mutual solution if once the president signs the piece of legislation you say look what those evil republicans did .
IBiteYou	cghwxr8	1396411621	. the washington post is not a conservative site . think progress is a liberal site . i legitimately have questions about this whole scenario in florida . i ve been reading about it for awhile . florida asked the feds for help in purging the voter rolls of those who were not legit . the feds would not give help . if florida had made the purge 100 days before the election it would have been ok .

spoiled_generation	ci9gjla	1402970971	. gt wait did you just complain about the imf coming up with a bullshit number for minimum wage reform and then criticize them for not being able to come up with a number . if anyone can come to that realization in about three seconds worth of thinking then they can and should or else they clearly have a motive . gt also what does diversity racial sexual economic political socio-economic or otherwise have to do with minimum wage . the minimum cost of living is similar throughout the entire united states because it s a very highly connected economy and there is nowhere where 7.25 an hour covers it . are you even being serious . you are going to compare the cost of living in akron ohio to that of nyc . i do n't even know how to respond to you . gt also the premise of a basic income is that the government s pays every citizen that ca n't afford it enough money to be able to live on no it isnt . it is a universal basic income for everybody a huge difference between that and your perception . gt the problem is the income you get from working a minimum wage job in the us at the moment is actually less then what is required to sustain a basic standard of living . because these jobs are designed for teenagers looking for mall money and semi-retired people . you ca n't raise a family dunking fries in oil no shit . gt this means you can either set basic income as what would be required to sustain a decent quality of life which is more thing you would get from a minimum wage job again you miss the completely obvious . minimum wage implies having a fucking job in the first place . basic income would apply to everybody even those who can not find work or are not able to work . minimum wage fails in this most basic attempt of providing for the under privileged . it is a solution with a track record of complete failure . gt also the premise of basic income is that the government would pay a standardized sum of money on a regular basis to all citizens even those that do n't necessarily need it . this would be unsustainable and wasteful for a country as large and populous as the usa really . why . those who did n't need it would be taxed on it and then spend it . maybe they would choose better careers because they re not enslaved to their health care provider . maybe they would donate it to charity . but anyways minimum wage has the same problem . youre asking that a wage to raise a family be paid to seniors teenagers and semi-retirees that do n't need it . if you re going to make that argument tell me how minimum wage is different . besides arguably the worst part of being poor in this culture is the stigma and the negativity associated with welfare . but if everyone were receiving payment that should pretty much disappear . nobody could any legitimate argument about those on the dole if everybody were collecting .

ryan_meets_wall	cltcfbe	1415158868	. gt do we have a socialist system in the us i was unaware of . the us is most closely a capitalist system crony capitalist if you want to be more precise . we have fuel assistance welfare foodstamps college grants medicare and medicaid and numerous other programs that are very socialist . the center for immigration studies has stated that most american workers do n't face competition from immigrants . npr has confirmed this as well saying that americans simply do n't compete for jobs against illegal immigrants . from an economic standpoint for workers in low wage positions it would mean only a 100 dollar increase per month . there s just little effect on wages . george borjas is one man . i ve work along side illegal immigrants in different jobs . i ve been on the ground in that environment . borjas can be an incredibly intelligent man but sometimes you need to be on the ground to understand . i ve never worked a job with illegal immigrants in which my wage was affected because of who i worked with . my wage has always been determined by a combination of the work i put in the wage the government requires my qualifications and what other similar companies pay . i ve never made anything less than 14 dollars an hour in a job working with illegal immigrants . so looking at the sources and comparing that to my experience it matches up . having a degree in labor history i know what business leaders have traditionally said about working class folks and about how they feel about how the economy should work in general . following that line of thinking there s little reason to expect that those beliefs have changed because they come from being in a position of power . heads of corporations have never believed in paying good wages for good work . history has shown us that . regardless of when and where this is usually the case no matter what the conditions . it s a fundamental consistency to economic and labor history . so taking the sources i ve read and studied along with my personal experience along with what i know about labor history i am prepared to say that illegal immigration is not the reason wages are low . the reason wages are low is because companies simply want to be as rich as possible and pay their workers as little as possible and can always find someone else to fill the position . there are plenty of americans who will fill those positions . they do n't need illegal immigrants .

ryan_meets_wall	cgaj9hd	1395668474	. 1 are you american . 2 if not allow me to explain . americans enjoy their freedom more than other countries i think . that is to say modern society is a balance between freedom and security right . so for example scandinavian countries generally feel that giving up some money in extra taxes is worth it for the security of healthcare . i tend to agree . however many americans feel we pay too much already and that we want to look out for ourselves . in some ways i agree i do n't have a ton of sympathy for people who smoke for fifty years and get cancer . they should have seen that coming . the issue is that americans love freedom more than security i do n't mean security as in limiting say freedom of speech and so we do n't like paying for things like education or healthcare . we d rather you do it yourself . many americans want freedom even if it is the freedom to destroy oneself hence why people care about guns so much for reasons i ca n't understand .

ryan_meets_wall	cgaqtgw	1395685362	. gt american here and i have to disagree with you . americans give great lip service to loving freedom but will give it up in a heartbeat if it is couched in the idea of patriotism . been to an airport lately . if you disagree with the tsa you must be supporting the terrorists . this is accurate but the thing of it is americans do n't associate that as giving up freedoms . most americans do n't feel like they are giving anything up when you talk about the tsa or the patriot act . its the whole nothing to hide nothing to fear mentality . i agree with you but i think many americans do n't look at it from your perspective . they do n't see it as giving up any freedom though they are of course .

ryan_meets_wall	ceojhfh	1389633187	. its not that hedges disagrees with christie though he does obviously . its that christie abuses his power in such a way that he resembles a despot . the argument is not difficult to make . despots can be democratically elected . it does n't have to be power taken by force . a despot is just someone who wields power in a cruel and forceful manner which christie very much does . remember that incident with the teacher . a synonym for despot is tyrant . tyrants were sometimes democratically elected in greece . you have to understand hedge s mindset he s talking from a historical perspective as opposed to the meaning we ve put behind the word since the start of the cold war .

ryan_meets_wall	cg6jrj2	1395243816	. i read the article . just because the writer said it does n't make it true . furthermore as you alluded to it s a very small minority . she s clearly angry that people who are n't working as hard as her are getting more benefit . okay i get that . the problem is she oversimplifies the problem . gt but i believe there are some folks who would n't have that child without the assistance that comes with it . sure but then what s the solution . to take away the assistance altogether . that s not the right answer . some people have argued setting up a system that provides for people regardless of having kids . i think that s a better solution . especially giving people free college . but the idea that because maybe 5 of recipients take advantage of the system we should just eliminate it as some have argued i do n't know exactly where you stand you have n't stated is n't the answer . gt you assume i am saying that they are rolling in money . i have never claimed that . when rent is 50 or more of your costs of living getting free rent can be very attractive . i did n't assume . you used the word enrich . it implies certain ideas . use a different word if that was n't your intent . like maybe going from utterly poor to only somewhat poor .
ryan_meets_wall	cfji37f	1392842305	. i feel for you . i often feel there should be a tax code for big business and another for little and mid sized business . obviously people need more money to survive but maybe the government could help cut costs in terms of what your business taxes are as compensation . i mean a small business is easy to monitor . it s hard to find abuse in corporations like wal mart because they are so big and people get lost in the shuffle . but if the government were to say trade wage increases with decreased taxes on a business by business basis small business and some mid level business only i think that could be workable . i mean the government could do a monthly check to make sure the business is increasing wages rather than just taking the tax breaks and running . i mean is that something that s workable for your business . im not sure what your business bottom line is . i know most small owners where i live are the ones who suffer from increased taxation and wages . big businesses usually just get out of it somehow .
ryan_meets_wall	chwjfdp	1401648452	. sure i would n't dispute that . but we ca n't just look at it in a vacuum . theres real reasons the us is the way it is and it is n't just due to the last twenty five years . you have to cobsider population size roling out healthcare for 300 million vs 25 million land size public transport issues and economics-what s good for north dakota is n't good for vermont and how the population is composed . i know this gets said a lot but the us is one of the most diverse countries in the worls . how do you get so many different cultures to agree . the theres the constitution which is an amazing document . but it also didnt consider public education or healthcare for all or blacks hispanics whites etc all living together . the us is n't bad . our people are generally good . look at marijuana legalization and gay rights . hell even guns rights activists usually come with the view that hey our government is turning fascist were gunna need these which i understand though i do n't think that s the answer . the us has huge issues but its not fair to say well scandinavia . its apples and oranges . i agreed with the potus when he said we have to find a uniquely american solution to our problems .
ryan_meets_wall	cfv0mw4	1394035275	. so one person in your life does it and you use it to explain one of the problems with society . im not trying to be rude but that s not exactly the correct way to solve a problem . also you cant guarantee that women would stop having babies . family size has actually decreased in the us not increased over the last 50 years . what i am saying is your claim is already happening even with the presence of social spending . its not just political suicide . its morally wrong . sorry your boyfriend or husband was an asshole good luck . that s your solution . im sorry but that s not a solution . i get that people do n't like paying into programs they receive nothing from . i totally do . i hate paying for the defense budget . but that does n't mean i am going to say we should just fire 1 out of 3 soldiers in the military best of luck to em . if you really want to fix the system you need to decrease poverty . you are n't going to do that with this solution . you ll only make it worse . as someone who had a kid young and while in college a few of my friends have as well all we ve done is work our butts off . by your logic we d suffer under those cuts despite the fact that i ve done all the right things since having said child . the problem with these solutions is they are blanket cuts that do n't differentiate . we know what happens when people ca n't afford to go to school or feed themselves . what happens to all those women who lose funding .
ryan_meets_wall	cfwsy6m	1394211339	. i get what you are saying but people should n't get a degree in something they do n't like doing . part of going to school is supposed to be that you get a job in something you like . i ca n't stand computer systems . its unbelievably boring and if i had to work in that field i d commit suicide inside of 5 years . so while i get what you are saying its also unrealistic to expect people to go into a field they do n't like .
ryan_meets_wall	cjfskcp	1407086065	. i do n't own a sword i hate my family in the sensr that ill leave them to pursue my calling and i tend to follow the ten commandments because those are good life rules in general . look i agree translation and such are not perfect . i think belief in christ today ya know some 2000 years later requires some research . obviously for his immediate disciples and those who witnessef him its different . i actually believe because i did extensive research into the historical background in which jesus of nazareth lived and raje everything he said in context . when taken in context much of the jargon and silliness of the bible tends to evaporate for me and it also allows me to have a more reasonable faith . for example i m a post millenialist universalist who believes jesus was seperate from god . i try to be somewhat reasonable about what i believe while recognizing its predicated on a faith in a being i ca n't see . in any event its hard to misconstrue jesus s call for peace love and understanding .
ryan_meets_wall	cm8jyxm	1416534586	. that s what i do n't get . congressman king is on television saying ya know he took an oath and i am sitting here say where s you re oath to pass laws the american people approve of . it ticks me off . i do n't like executive action but i hate inaction even more .
ryan_meets_wall	cjojces	1407885191	. i never said that . i just said that bush s election in 2000 was cheating . not every republican . hell lincoln was a republican and he s our greatest president . one fraud election does n't mean they all are . i also should point out i do n't vote for either party . i voted for elizabeth warren and for barack obama twice . other than that i generally do n't vote precisely for the reason you stated . however if you think mitt romney and the potus are the same you are gravely mistaken .
ryan_meets_wall	civdc59	1405168684	. hi american historian here . its not that men like wasington or jefferson were perfect or always made sense . its that they built a government from nothing and gave people freedom and representative democracy . of course they were imperfect . they owned slaves did n't ackowledge women and feared direct democracy . however they were still quite forward thinking for their time and many like hamilton and madison might be political geniuses . they built our country for better or worse from nothing.we revere them because they were amazing human beings . not perfect but amazing none the less . also i m not a republican .
ryan_meets_wall	cljbs0w	1414241426	. the nra doesnt care about individual rights they care about gun sales . dan carlin did a podcast on this and hit the nail on thr head . the biggest threat to gun ownership isnt liberlas like myself . its psychos with guns . if these shootings stop then we have no leg to stand on . but the nra rrefuses to work with anyone on the issue . if voters wanted a law that said if you point your gun at someone for no reason you go to jail for thirty years alongside a mental health package youd see a massive drop in gun violence and average gun owners would n't be affected at all . but the nra wo n't even talk about it . eventually the hysteria over the shootings will get so bad that the feds will have to take action . so ask yourself realistically do you want your guns for a few more years only to see them banned outright . or do you want soem kind of comprehensive bill that really addresses the problem . if you want the latter then the nra doesnt represent you .
ryan_meets_wall	cfl3x0w	1393002009	. well to be fair and balanced it s not like african americans would vote for any black person . they also voted for the president because he stood for their interests . who were they going to vote for mccain . romney . paul . please . the president has not done a great job i grant that . but the idea that somehow anyone who voted for him is either an idiot or voted for him because he s black seems foolish .

ryan_meets_wall	cfhyfsk	1392688617	. exactly . i generally feel that my idea of a budget would be far more efficient for example id rather have single payer in which case medicaid and medicare could actually be eliminated and replaced by something far more solvent and efficient which most conservatives do n't take into account . i also would drastically reduce the military budget . all in all a true progressive budget actually would be extremely effective i think .
ryan_meets_wall	cg6718x	1395197535	. gt what i mean is rather than giving subsidized rent and food stamps perhaps the children should be placed in foster care or an orphanage while the parents spend their time looking for work or getting their education . the problem is that there can be quite a fair amount of abuse in foster parent homes . it happens . further still it s a slippery slope . there needs to be very strict limits on what bad parenting is . if we are making the case that in order to have kids you should be able to financially provide for them a what does that mean exactly b it assumes that financial security is the most important determining factor in parenting and its not . i grew up incredibly poor i never had a doubt i was loved though and that helped me grow up fairly normal . i think its a bad thing for society to define what good parenting looks like many of the people making that decision might not have ever been parents and yet assume they know what it takes to be an effective parent . i know you do n't intend it this way . but what you are really making a case for is government control over peoples personal lives something i am not an advocate for . it can lead to serious violations of human rights .
ryan_meets_wall	chwcnip	1401629232	. i also think the question about guns is ridiculous . every american is different . i m for abolishing the second amendment . so again stop being ridiculous . youre caracaturizing americans based on a few laws or people . it makes you look really ignorant . every state has different laws . most people think our healthcare system is wrong . but it takes time to change . americans in general value human life the same as anyone else . americans are legalizing gay marriage have asserted women s rights in recent elections and voted for a president who said he would end the wars in iraq and afghanistan and close guantamo bay . so id say yea we care . also the worst consertaves in europe are the same as the ones here . fascists are fascists . france just voted a couple into european parliament so please tell me again how enlightened . europe is and dumb and backwards americans are .
ryan_meets_wall	cm9irwi	1416622880	. well the washington post released a set of polls that show americans tend to be for stronger borders and a pathway to citizenship with penalties . so in other words if we had a moderate republican party alongside the democrats who are way too close to the center for my liking by the way that includes the potus who in general i do n't support they would have passed the senate bill and that bill represents based on polling what most americans think is reasonable . as for your link i am not sure what exactly in that article obama has violated .

ryan_meets_wall	cm4la70	1416188918	. true sadly . but is the easiest and really most cost efficient method . i did n't say how likely it was a congressman from the south would vote for such a measure . it s sad because if you went to coal miners and offered them this opportunity i am sure a ton of them would take the option and any more would consider it . i just do n't understand the obsession with coal you know . i mean it s not sustainable it s bad for the environment and it kills the people who are mining it .

ForgettableUsername	cn7ws08	1419818196	. the reason people were convicted due to faulty memories is that jurors believed them . an educated trained knowledgeable person would know not to rely on eyewitness testimony . better methods and technology do improve our ability to determine guilt but as these methods become more advanced they become more difficult to understand . as technology advances more and more of the technological aspects of law enforcement will go over the jury s heads and the courts will become increasingly dependent on technical experts and the jurors will trust or distrust these experts for emotional rather than rational reasons as they are not prepared to evaluate the technical arguments . trial by jury is hardly a universal right . in the uk minor offenses are tried without juries . in south africa there are no jury trials . ultimately it s not very useful as a safeguard . a corrupt judge could work around an uncooperative jury . a corrupt attorney could deliberately present the evidence badly .

ForgettableUsername	cgxjimc	1398025937	. they might not mean as much as we might like but they mean more than they do in china . china is a single-party state that actively suppresses opposition parties . we have two major parties so there s at least a one-dimensional spectrum of political choices . the fact that there are two parties mean that elected officials need to be careful about pissing off their constituents too much because a relatively small group of voters switching from one party to the other could be enough to get them voted out of office . this is rarely a consideration in single-party states .

ForgettableUsername	cgsmw4s	1397526068	. pure majority rule is a terrible idea . the average person does n't have the experience or the intelligence to run a business much less a government . the whole point of a representative democracy is to have trained skilled leaders who are held accountable to the people not to do exactly everything the people wish . if these leaders are overtly terrible they get voted out but it does n't even remotely select for the best leaders . it s just a mechanism for removing the worst sort of leaders from power . inevitably very good leaders also get removed because not everyone agrees on everything so the result is that most elected leaders are mediocre . that s why practically everybody s approval rating sits at 40-60 . but although they re mediocre at least for the most part they re not overtly dangerous .

urnbabyurn	cfoqwg4	1393373976	. gt the advanced medical technology association advamed is a trade association that leads the effort to advance medical technology in order to achieve healthier lives and healthier economies around the world . advamed represents 80 percent of medical technology firms in the united states and acts as the common voice for companies producing medical devices diagnostic products and health information systems . yeah that s a credible survey of firms that produce medical devices .
urnbabyurn	cf6ysez	1391541240	. what about reduced business expenses . the income from jobs is n't a pure gain . i agree that having an idle workforce is bad but thats because those workers are n't working . if income was a pure gain then why not just set up more transfer payments to the unemployed .
urnbabyurn	cfth5xu	1393878855	. ah i see . though does n't this depend on which measure of money supply m1-mn we are using . the swaps are also taking risk out of the market no . so that raises the value of assets help privately and costs the fed in terms of the added risk . i m bad at macro so these are genuine questions .
urnbabyurn	cfpkn9d	1393455587	. while a homeless person zero income buys fewer dvds than a working person it s not obvious that the increase is in greater proportion to the increase in income . poor people also buy less healthcare on average . healthcare is n't a luxury because the income elasticity of demand is quite low . the definition of luxury goods is whether the income elasticity is greater than 1 . simply having a positive income elasticity does not imply a luxury good . further it may have a large elasticity for low to medium wages but level off at higher incomes . so does a person who earns 200k/yr buy more than twice the quantity of dvds as someone earning 100k . i doubt it but it s an empirical question .
urnbabyurn	cftg3h3	1393876710	. gt inflation helps people in debt no . unexpected inflation helps people in debt . but if inflation is 2 or 4 and stays at that rate then debtors are n't benefitting . the inflation rate is part of the nominal interest paid on nominal loans . if inflation had been 0 when the loan was issued expected to remain at 0 during the life of the loan and actually is 0 then the debtors are no better or worse off than if the inflation rate had been 2 expected to be 2 and is realized to be 2 over the life of the loan . the lender would simply have charged a higher nominal rate reflecting that . gt deflation helps the poor because it allows them to buy more of what they need for less money . no deflation does not help the poor . the problem you are pointing to is n't inflation makes things more expensive inflation does n't do that . it simply raises the nominal price level not the real prices of goods and services . the poor are hurt when real wages lag behind prices . deflation would not help with this .
urnbabyurn	ckdhh1t	1410276889	. look at the passage of the 17th amendment congress specifically senate clearly did n't want to act and surely would not have . the states threatened to pass it themselves which forced congress to cede . the threat should be enough . but at the moment there is n't a threat . there are enough people that see this as a restriction on political speech and will take years of debate to convince otherwise if at all .

urnbabyurn	cl1eqdd	1412551086	. but that s clearly wrong . more people are working and unemployment is lower than when obama started . that was my point . the fact that people ca n't remember how bad the economy was collapsing in 2008 leading up to the inauguration is a separate issue entirely .
urnbabyurn	cew6ufp	1390421671	. what about counter examples like civil rights which was really a top down change that is still occurring . popular narrative is that the courts made a ruling e.g . brown v boe far before public sentiment shifted for majorities . surely there is endogeneity here where each have causal effects on the other . i would argue for example that the shift in marriage equality opion was in large part pushed by a bunch of popular figures evolving and not simply an exogenous development that caused the politicians to evolve .

urnbabyurn	chca5tc	1399506377	. you seem to simply describing the legal doctrine of bundle of rights . indeed a property right is the right to act or prevent action by others . i rent an apartment which does n't grant me ownership of every use of that apartment i ca n't tear down walls often ca n't rent it out to others ca n't open up a brothel . when i buy auto insurance the insurance company is given the property right to liability from accidents that may occur . when i get a warranty for a tv set the issuer retains liability for damages from manufacture . i actually thought it was a nice little post on property rights .
urnbabyurn	cgpcihr	1397170016	. no one is blaming republicans for the bad parts . they are pointing out the hypocrisy of opposing a policy they supported and implemented just two years earlier . the democrats will own this law and just like with ss and medicare/medicaid after the dust settles the gop will line up to support the law like the rest of us .
urnbabyurn	cf4ka2c	1391284819	. you are mistaken to call supply side neoclassical economics . though says law is loosely interpreted to mean supply makes demand this is gross simplification and not an argument for tax cuts on the wealthy . supply side economics is not economics at all but a purely political terms for a certain set of policies pushed starting with thatcher and reagan . individually these policies borrow from all over to cherry pick an agenda . keynesian macro would include tax cuts during downturns though not targeted at wealthy per se . and the notion that cutting taxes raises revenues is generally agreed as possible so long as tax rates are sufficiently high much higher than the have been since kennedy .

urnbabyurn	ckb9gbe	1410056729	. gt wealthy people have a tendency to buy more stuff so a fair tax would still be based on income and everybody would feel the sting a little less since you would n't see a couple hundred dollars disappear from your paycheck before you ever get to do anything with it .

urnbabyurn	ch7wd9f	1399053646	. countries with currency collapses always have other political problems occurring not simply high debt . it takes fear of instability in the government to trigger that . i do n't think some separatists in nv are going to overthrow the government anytime soon . my point was in regards to the bankruptcy claim . national debt is n't about spending more than we have . the recession led to a great deal of idle resources and spending would have put those to use . the rising debt was n't because the us was trying to make more than it had . it was the result of people reducing current consumption following the shock to household asset values .
urnbabyurn	chjpffo	1400265037	. that s not true . the source of lost jobs is a demand drop not supply . according to the cbo . the labor supply is backwards bending but not at 10/hour . edit the cited loss of 500,000 jobs is in terms of full time equivalent . it is not saying anything about moving from part time to full time . the report does not state anything about people working fewer jobs but rather overall fewer hours .
urnbabyurn	cgedv06	1396035493	. no . if i owe 100 in taxes but then get a deduction for 20 because i install solar panels that lowers my taxes to 80 . that 20 is not simply lower taxes . it is spending in that the government is reducing my tax burden because of a deduction . it is not the same as lowering everyone s taxes to 80 and hence the cbo and more broadly when performing an economic analysis that 20 is counted as spending . it would be no different than if the government taxed me by 100 and then spent 20 giving it to me . deductions exemptions and credits are targeted towards influencing economic decisions and are treated as spending . this is not the same as lowering everyone s statutory tax rate both on behavior and the opportunity cost to the government of these deductions .
urnbabyurn	cjc100w	1406732093	. it s not that there is a july 4th adjustment . it s seasonal . so if there is a yoy trend of seeing x change then that s used to adjust . the problem is that most mainstream news does n't distinguish and it s hard to know if the seasonal adjustment is being used . similarly many reports fail to mention annualized versus absolute change .
urnbabyurn	cg61cj1	1395185344	. i agree that the second amendment is not absolute much like the first . so the sentiment i agree with . not every weapon is legal at all times . in other words there is room for restrictions though it also clearly establishes a right to common firearms . i did disagree with the heller ruling . i m a pragmatist not a strict interpretationalist or whatever scalia is calling himself at the moment . in that regard i side with pragmatists like posner who are skeptical of the ability to interpret an 18th century context by revising history and that legislation is best done by the legislatures gt scalia is a pertinacious critic of the use of legislative history to illuminate statutory meaning and one reason for his criticism is that a legislature is a hydra-headed body whose members may not share a common view of the interpretive issues likely to be engendered by a statute that they are considering enacting . but when he looks for the original meaning of eighteenth-century constitutional <SPECIAL> he did in his opinion in district of columbia v heller holding that an ordinance forbidding people to own handguns even for the defense of their homes violated the second <SPECIAL> is doing legislative history . gt judge j harvie wilkinson iii has argued that because the historical analysis in heller is from the standpoint of advocates of a constitutional right to own handguns for personal self-defense at best inconclusive judicial self-restraint dictated that the district of <SPECIAL> ordinance not be invalidated . his argument derives new support from a surprising source judge <SPECIAL> foreword to scalia and <SPECIAL> book . the foreword lauds the book to the skies but toward the end it strikes the following subversive note <SPECIAL> <SPECIAL> have intrinsic meanings the significance of an expression depends on how the interpretive community alive at the time of the <SPECIAL> adoption under-stood those words . the older the text the more distant that interpretive community from our own . at some point the difference becomes so great that the meaning is no longer recoverable <SPECIAL> when that happens easterbrook continues the courts should <SPECIAL> that meaning has been lost so that the living political community must <SPECIAL> the <SPECIAL> political <SPECIAL> in heller consisted of the elected officials and the electorate of the district of columbia . .
urnbabyurn	cjzwrfy	1408971667	. it s not that clear where the incidence of corporate taxes end up though i would agree that there tends to be a concensus that it largely is passed on to consumers and labor . the problem i have with mankiws call for repealing it is that his alternative is a flat tax . i can not get behind that . what happened to the mankiw who started the pigou club . why is he so quiet about emissions taxes these days . a flat tax can be made fair for the poor but it shifts a great deal of burden from rich to middle .
urnbabyurn	ckba4dp	1410058354	. well thanks for your kindness as well though i still disagree . i agree it would exclude the poor who already do n't pay federal income taxes anyway so i m not seeing that as a benefit to them . the way income taxes are structured the middle class does n't pay taxes on those dollars below that amount anyway so again unless you are cutting rates it s not a benefit to the middle class . the rich benefit a lot from this as they no longer face higher rates on those additional dollars earned . so this means we have two choices take in less revenue from the tax or raise the rate which ends up hitting the middle class . there s really no way to structure a flat tax or consumption tax in a way that does n't help the rich at the expense of the middle class . i simply do n't think our goals should be to lower individual tax rates nor should we be reducing tax revenues . i am especially opposed to primarily lowering taxes on the wealthy . these are all opinions so that s fine to disagree with . what s not an opinion is that a consumption tax is a shift in tax burdens away from the wealthy .

urnbabyurn	ckb81lj	1410053436	. yes . same thing just collected on consumption instead of income . it s a big giveaway to the wealthy . if i earn 100k and pay under a progressive tax code a higher rate then someone earning 40k taxing consumption will mean i now pay a lower rate than now and the person earning 40k pays more than i do as a percentage of income . why . because a person earning 40k is spending most of that while i am putting a significant portion into savings and investment . furthermore the rate is no longer progressive so it compounds the issue . look who s promoting this . you think those wealthy donors to freedom works really are promoting a plan to pay more in taxes . either you do n't understand the math behind this or you are misrepresenting the tax .
KawaiiBakemono	cl308n6	1412704817	. while that s partially true you also have to think about this if a nation has 100 billion people and 700 million of them are murdered the per capita murder rate would still be less than a nation of 10,000 in which 100 people were killed . sometimes the numbers matter regardless of population differences .

KawaiiBakemono	ck87iod	1409768571	. gt there ca n't be any additional costs to university departments with respect to more complicated technology right . the fact that direct state funding is down per student ca n't play any role right . clearly the fact that a bachelor s degree is essentially required for even entry level jobs these days ca n't play any role right . those are all reasons for tuition increase but without those guaranteed loans the schools would never realistically be able to raise tuition so sharply without expecting to to lose a lot of money from bankrupt students . so yes the schools are charging more because of all the things you are stating but the reason they can charge so much more and still have a reliable incoming student body with enough money to pay the ridiculously high price of tuition is because the government is essentially covering the bill . so i think you are both right but you are also talking about two different things .

KawaiiBakemono	cibrbiy	1403199339	. gt but then you are taking the stance that it s okay for small companies under 50 employees to be exempt . so are they bad guys or not i do n't understand . the idea is that if your business is large enough to support 50 or more full time employees you are in a position to provide simple needs to these employees . speaking from experience you do not add employees just to have more people . you add them because your current number is not enough to handle the amount of product you are selling . basically each employee makes their own salary for you plus x.xx which goes towards other expenses including your net profit . if adding employees does not add to your net profit you should not be hiring more people . by the time you get to 50 your net should be high enough where you as a business owner can afford to cut into that net profit in order to provide care for the people who work for you . i m sure they chose the number 50 for a reason optimal was likely lower than that and it s likely that they ran some calculation based on average net profit and found that once a business grows to that level removing x.xx per employee would be acceptable . of course the businesses such as mine with 50-100 employees are unhappy about this but many of those businesses such as mine were already providing health coverage for full time employees so the difference was not such a big deal . i suppose what i m saying here is that it s one thing to have a struggling business and be unable to provide care for the people who work for you . if you are making good enough money to employ 50 people however you have to take the lives of those people into your hands to a certain degree since your life is in a good state . it pays to be a business owner but once you are a successful one there are certain responsibilities that come with it . before the aca there was no accountability for shirking on those responsibilities .

dilatory_tactics	cemrg9r	1389419419	. it does n't work like that unfortunately . not having a law or policy on an issue is like having a law or policy on an issue that favors a certain set of interests . for example if we did n't have environmental protections then some industries would make a lot more money at the expense of the environment and the general welfare and those industries that did not pollute as much would be priced out of the market . so congress has to make a set of decisions and tradeoffs as to which interests will benefit and which will be harmed from certain policies in the free market . that s why power and money are indistinguishable and why we need caps on money if we do n't want to live in an aristocracy .

dilatory_tactics	ckbtpu7	1410119448	. obscene wealth inequality like slavery used to be is the moral and political issue of our time . wealth means that you have control of resources that others need and want which gives you the parasitic/predatory ability to extract increasingly higher rents/value from others and further concentrate your wealth . it used to be that slaveowners who owned the most slaves were considered the most successful people in society and that was who we worshiped . then we realized that it is harmful and wrong for individuals to be able to parasitically extract that much rent/value from others/society so we made owning slaves criminal and illegal . we live in a time when the obscenely wealthy are able to extract obscene and increasingly higher rents/value from the rest of society and we worship the most effective predators/parasites as paragons of success . we need to see that it is criminally not okay to be obscenely wealthy in the same way that it is criminally not okay to be even a benevolent slave-owner . and it s not a matter of individuals voluntarily giving away their slaves . obscene wealth needs to be seen as criminal and limited via taxation . because either our so-called elites should live in the same nation/society as everyone else where they have a vested interest in serving the common public to which they belong or they will continue to be highly effective predators/parasites who have no stake in the health/welfare of the society they re living in or the nation they re sucking dry . so long as being obscenely wealthy remains okay in the eyes of the people instead of being seen as criminal and so long as not speaking out against slavery/obscene wealth remains okay in the eyes of the people then the predation/parasitism will continue and the criminals will continue to run the system for their own benefit at the expense of everyone else .

dilatory_tactics	ckdr072	1410294893	. 1 . it limits the both the incentive and power to be a predator/parasite on society so people will have more incentive to actually serve society and contribute instead of capturing more resources for themselves via corruption and rent-seeking . and winner take-all wo n't be the main mode of economic survival so human virtues like cooperation and compassion will be allowed to flourish over vicious self-seeking . and seeing the obscenely wealthy as criminals and predators/parasites like slaveowners instead of as paragons of success for which everyone needs to strive will do wonders for how people see the people in society who contribute tremendously but do n't have the predatory power to capture production . so people like researchers and scientists and teachers who grow and share knowledge or people who volunteer to help others without needing to get something out of it . these are the people that allow everyone to flourish not the people who capture obscene amounts of wealth for themselves well beyond what they need to live extremely well who parasitically extract rents from everyone else . 2 . we can implement a progressive wealth tax as suggested by thomas pikkety . it can and should be done notwithstanding the protestations of the obscenely wealthy . just as with ending slavery there was a lot of insane ideological baggage that we had to debunk as to why people justified slavery as okay but it was not okay . seeing the obscenely wealthy as paragons of success instead of as criminally parasitic slaveowners is no different .

dilatory_tactics	ceutifj	1390278682	. the important thing to see is that rational public policy arguments will never ever ever convince plutocrats to give up any money or power or even tax themselves even a little bit . they have a vested interest in maintaining the illusion that we re having a rational debate about what policies are best for the public but all they have is bullshit obfuscation propaganda and distraction because no rational argument will ever ever ever convince plutocrats to give up any money or power . they play up the uberman contributor fantasy that people are contributing millions of dollars of year worth of value to society far more than they need to live extremely well to justify their extraction of all the nation s wealth and taking undue credit for the contribution of technology labor and society . in today s fast-paced digital age world they can always find lots of shady exploitative and actively harmful ways to extract labor goods and services and economic activity out of the nation and the world see libor . and they can stay well ahead of whatever regulations and rules society can come up with which not only do they write and keep from being written but when they are written they are complex behind the times and extremely difficult to enforce even when the errant plutocrat is caught . the only enforceable solution is global private wealth/income caps but it s not a rational debate we re having and we need to stop pretending like it is . the plutocrats and their apologists are n't going to listen to rational debate that they need to limit their own wealth/power so it s going to take some sort of mlk-style march on washington for that to happen . <SPECIAL> can either have democracy in this country or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few but we <SPECIAL> have <SPECIAL> <SPECIAL> louis brandeis .

dilatory_tactics	ceus18l	1390275421	. people in government have to have that much power because rules always determine where money goes just indirectly . rules on pollution give cleaner industries an edge on the market no rules give the edge to polluting industries . and on and on and on in every market the rules determine supply demand incentives and where resources go just indirectly . rich people have that much power because that is the nature of wealth . wealth the ability to extract the labor goods and services and economic activity out of the nation and put it where you want . that s the same power legislators have with their ability to make rules it s just a little bit more indirect for legislators but not much more . the only enforceable solution is to cap the amount of power that can be gained through corruption exploitation rent-seeking etc . i.e private wealth caps . laws ca n't keep up with all the corrupt and harmful ways there are to make tons of money at the public expense particularly when rich plutocrats are writing the laws . and of course they wo n't give up the uberman contributor fantasy due to some rational debate let alone give up any money or power . it s going to take an mlk-style march on washington to get private wealth caps in place but that is really what needs to happen .

dilatory_tactics	cm1wr37	1415927178	. the idea of public investment has been completely lost in america because the glorious for-profit free market can solve everything better than the horribly inefficient gubmint . this is evident in debates on public spending which never even consider examining the benefits of what we get for that spending . suppose we were spending 3 trillion dollars on 10 trillion dollars worth of value for the nation . then it would be utterly retarded and irrational to cut spending to the bone would n't it . maybe there are second and third-order effects of public investment that are n't captured by crude gdp estimates . cutting public investment and spending at all costs is an especially harmful view during a recession when our infrastructure is falling apart and the glorious free market is n't leading to the widely shared prosperity that is supposed to occur when we just give job creators more money . we ve also lost the sense to use progressive taxation as a cap on political power . in the same way that we do n't allow people to become tyrannical despots or slaveowners we should not allow people to be obscenely wealthy because their political power then overrides everyone else s interests . and that view was espoused by the quintessential american teddy roosevelt no man should receive a dollar unless that dollar has been fairly earned . every dollar received should represent a dollar s worth of service rendered <SPECIAL> not gambling in stocks but service rendered . the really big fortune the swollen fortune by the mere fact of its size acquires qualities which differentiate it in kind as well as in degree from what is possessed by men of relatively small means . therefore i believe in a graduated income tax on big fortunes and in another tax which is far more easily collected and far more effective <SPECIAL> a graduated inheritance tax on big fortunes properly safeguarded against evasion and increasing rapidly in amount with the size of the estate . teddy roosevelt emphasis added without caps on wealth concentrated wealth inevitably leads to oligarchy . right now 1 of the people our elites have interests completely divorced from those of 99 of the people . wealth means that one legally controls critical resources that others need which gives one the ability to extract increasingly higher rents from the rest of the population . because this increasing rent-extraction makes people more desperate for money and work it becomes a buyer s market for labor . because it s a buyer s market for labor wages and working conditions are naturally depressed because workers have no bargaining power so they have to work harder and harder just to stand still economically . rent-extraction capabilities of the elites increase and workers become more impoverished . and elites are fine with this because their interest is in predatory rent-seeking not the economic health or wellbeing of the nation as such except to the extent necessary to keep their host alive but subdued . the kinds of policies that we need to bring ourselves into a sane healthy 21st century economy are 1 . a piketty-style progressive wealth and significantly higher capital gains taxes to align the interests of the 1 with everyone else . 2 . publicly financed elections to limit the power of elites to buy political power at the expense of everyone else s interests . 3 . medicare for everyone so rising healthcare costs are n't eating up all of people s wages . 4 . an updated fair labor standards act to a 32 hour workweek to at least acknowledge that technology and automation should be freeing people from the insane rat race that we re all indoctrinated into as the only possible system of economic organization . until it becomes socially unacceptable to be obscenely wealthy in the same way that it became socially unacceptable to be a slaveowner both are just the ability to legally extract obscenely high rents from others the american middle class will continue to be hollowed out by elites who are not interested in the health or wellbeing of the nation at all so long as their profits are healthy . patriotism needs to stop being about supporting the free market and insane foreign wars and it needs to be about taking back our country from our fucking oligarchs and investing in the nation s long term prosperity .
dilatory_tactics	cei9461	1388967578	. as i ve said in another thread when this refrain comes up i used to think the solution would be to get the money out of politics . unfortunately money and politics are essentially indistinguishable because money power and power begets more money . an actual solution would be to put caps on private wealth in the same way that we put caps and checks and balances in government power . in other words the rationale for limited powers in government is that unchecked concentrated power in inevitably leads to corruption and oppression of the masses . that rationale also applies to unchecked concentrated private power . <SPECIAL> can either have democracy in this country or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few but we <SPECIAL> have <SPECIAL> justice louis brandeis it s a bright line rule so it s actually enforceable it puts a cap on what can be taken or gained through corruption and it will actually ensure that wealth can go elsewhere from where it is clearly not needed . as someone said in another thread how can wealth ever trickle down if the container at the top can expand indefinitely . it s the only way that i see that will actually end the class war and save our democracy .
dilatory_tactics	cev2ncf	1390316215	. no the point of having a government that forces people to pay for things they might not want to pay for is to solve the free rider problem that allows people to leech off the contributions of others . there s no practical or cost-effective way to exclude people from roads once they re built or national defense once the army is paid for or environmental regulations once they re enforced and because people benefit they should have to pay no matter how vehemently they disavow the benefits of those services . there are any number of social coordination problems that are solved by having a government of laws in place ancap propaganda notwithstanding . the legal system not only protects people s property rights it overprotects them . hedge fund managers ceo s wall street bankers if they legally exploit and defraud the public of millions no rational argument will convince them to give up any of their money or power and so there is no recourse because the government protects their property rights no matter how ill-gotten .

dilatory_tactics	cesfcuk	1390013698	. there s no such thing as the free market because the laws rules and regulations that determine what people can and ca n't do structure supply and demand and thus the free market in a particular way . for example depending on whether pollution is regulated and how and to what extent either industries that pollute will be given a huge edge on the market thus pricing out cleaner industries or clean industries will actually be able to compete on price in the market . or if worker protections or minimum wage laws are not put in place or the government pursues austerity policies during a recession instead of investing in projects to create jobs then workers have to accept shittier job conditions and wages because they have less bargaining power on the market . this dynamic applies to every industry ever what are the rules and how do they affect supply demand and market power . it s not as clear cut as unregulated free market good let s get the government out . another issue is that our plutocrats like to encourage the illusion that we are having some sort of rational public policy discussion as to what is best for the general welfare . the truth is that no rational argument will ever ever ever convince our plutocrats to give up any money or power whatsoever no matter how rational no matter how obviously beneficial for the public welfare . we evolved a sense of fairness because in our ancestral environments if a group of people were hogging all the resources and food for themselves we understood that that would lead to chaos and worse outcomes for everyone . yet when the waltons or wall street bankers whose wealth whose ability to extract labor goods and services and economic activity out of the nation without contributing anything of real social value is obscene there is no recourse . all you have to do as a conservative/plutocrat apologist is to ignore distract and obfuscate the masses with the illusion that we are having some sort of rational discussion on public policy when in fact no rational argument will ever convince our plutocrats to give up any money or power because there is no punishment for being a selfish horrible person . the millionaires in congress who are happily cutting food stamps are completely deaf to the voices and interests of those who are not rich and powerful i.e most of the nation . the illusion that some rational argument will convince our elites to serve the people and not themselves has been broken . so we should not only be angry we should question their legitimacy . people see that congress is serving the rich but are deaf to the interests of the people so they want to get the money out of politics with publicly financed elections . the problem is that it is n't possible to get the money out of politics because money power and power begets more money . wealth the power to extract labor goods and services and economic activity out of the nation/world . publicly financed elections would do nothing to stop corruption because irrespective of how your campaign is funded once you re in office the incentive is to write policies that favor industries that will pay you back once you are out of office . so the political incentive is to say whatever it takes to get elected but then secretly or not serve the rich and powerful . the only real policy solution to this problem would be to cap wealth in the same way we cap public power because in the modern world there is no distinction between the two . but of course our plutocrats wo n't implement that solution voluntarily . and that s why i ve been arguing shameless plug . because our plutocrats are n't going to give up any money power or self-serving voluntarily . we actually have to go and make them . we can either have democracy in this country or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few but we <SPECIAL> have <SPECIAL> justice louis brandeis .

Jae_Siever	cjfw1eu	1407093973	. i remember that the prisoners hated the work . they were smashing and spitting on the produce and it was considered a failure . last i read the farm owners were demanding the laws be over turned . all of georgia s neighboring states on the other hand had a pretty large boost in economic activity with the new arrivals . they were offering to pay americans in georgia 10 an hour plus x amount of change per box of peaches harvested . it did n't get any traction .
Jae_Siever	cjkdqtb	1407491284	. illegals ca n't get housing assistance or claim welfare . it s easy to double check just try to do it yourself and provide no proof of citizenship . yeah no assistance for you . bush started the war while giving tax cuts then started a second one in iraq . that failed green energy program slyndra i believe . was a bad investment but not nearly as bad as the on-going wars . investing in renewable energy was a good choice and i hope they continue to pursue it . i d rather have that than our wars and occupation/embassies in countries that clearly do n't want us involved . nsa has been around and spying you for a looonnnnggg time . even the simpsons have had skits about them and spying . an episode from 1997 i think is one you can find online easily . ca n't disagree with the rest but it s a pretty tough thing to get done . non politicians should really get together on one issue and pursue the hell out of it . whether it s cutting funding to the nsa or reallocating funds away from militarization of police and our whack ass wars yo we all need to scratch at least one of these things off our collective lists . i m sure somewhere the wants have to overlap .
Jae_Siever	cjj8iuw	1407386610	. the same can be said about water only whether you want it or not you ca n't live without water . should we hand over control of the planet to say a bottling company . people are n't asking them to go out business pro tip they re highly profitable they simply want them to pay the same as other smaller businesses have to pay . they can afford it and you know they can . if they were barely making ends meet in the states they would have gone to another country already because globally the demand is high all around . an oil and gas company ca n't simply pollute without limit and then get tax breaks and subsidies while leaving the local population to live in the polluted land they leave behind . i m sorry if you want to be a slave to a corporation but i d like them to simply pay a fair amount of taxes . 35 is the rate they pay 11 or less . if they could start paying 20 i d be pretty satisfied . as a side note they charge as much for a gallon of gas as they possibly can regardless of all other factors . if the consumer is willing to pay 8 dollars a gallon they will charge 8 dollars a gallon . come tomorrow morning if everyone suddenly stopped paying for gas they would start offering incentives or lower the price immediately .
Jae_Siever	cjxwj6s	1408749185	. despite what the other posters may claim about chicago being somewhat liberal it is not . chicago is not an easy place to change . even martin luther king jr faced a massive amount of opposition and protests when he came to the city to talk about the threat of the projects and conditions inside the city . it was probably the most hostile reception he ever ever encountered . even the occupy chicago like the wallstreet ones did n't really find much success . our democratic mayor cracked down hard on protests in addition your everyday average citizens seemed to harass the protesters daily . it s an opinion piece but i kinda hope they re right . it would be nice to have an actual progressive politician in chicago for once instead of mainstream republicans or mainstream democrats like rahm .
Jae_Siever	cixorn1	1405393441	. i would have voted for gary johnson had he gone up he made a lot of sense . but mccain and sarah palin went up instead and the rest is history a sad page in history for everyone . while i do n't consider myself liberal you are right most people on that side are too passive . sure obama is better than romney and bush but that does n't mean he s perfect . we have a wealth of things to attack obama for but his race name and birth certificate are what the tea party and republicans attack . why are republicans yelling benghazi instead of pointing to things like the comcast and time warner merger . or how he basically de-regulated the healthcare industry . the simple answer is there sponsors do n't want to bring attention to these things . as much as liberals are guilty of not being mean or outraged at the things the obama administration does the conservative section libertarians included are so fractured they ca n't even put forth their best candidates gary johnson for example . i d vote for bernie sanders gary johnson maybe even elizabeth warren for president . that does n't mean i d support nancy pelosi just because she s a democrat nor hilary clinton . but knowing the republican party they ll probably put up jeb bush and basically force everyone to vote for the lesser of two evils .
Jae_Siever	cjl4xnn	1407553560	. truth hurts i m sorry mitt romney pushed it in his state years before obama tried it . you d think they would support their own healthcare bill . do n't feel bad if i had to defend republicans or democrats i d run away from debates and facts too .
Jae_Siever	cj86mjo	1406357365	. bush and the current batch of republicans in congress have been undermining and gutting the epa for over 12 years . if you sit here today and wonder why it is n't working then my time spent responding is wasted . you ll believe what you want to believe . i do n't see obama as a savior he s a big business politician who waits for public approval before he takes a stand . the difference between us is you think the government under obama is the problem and that a company like halliburton would n't dare fabricate a story or withhold information . whereas i realize all of them are basically to blame in different ways for the same problem . i also can remember more than the last 4 years of history . were you asleep during the bush years .
Jae_Siever	cjfw61o	1407094271	. they still use them as workers even in prison and we have more people imprisoned than any other country . you pick strange things to be upset about . sadly the majority of gangs and the worst types are american maybe a cartel operates here and there like selling high grade marijuana to new york but they use the hell s angels to deliver it . it s a strange thing . as much as we blame illegal immigrants they re the only group of people on the planet that buy american products . it s like every mexican i ve ever met wants an american truck but every american i meet either want an italian car or drives a japanese car .
Jae_Siever	cjmvd39	1407736382	. this following comment is for people who dislike immigration and forget that people existed here before them . a lot of research was done and certain tribes in the new world were making leaps and bounds in terms of science astrology and governing . it is believed had they not encountered other technologically advanced humans they would have surpassed the rest of the world in some areas . now some tribes differ on what they specialized in so let s keep that in mind before we move on . okay time to go into specifics . the mayans are considered to be the most mathematically advanced civilization . along with advancements in agriculture science and art they were nothing short of a miracle themselves . they had pyramids that rivaled the ones in egypt and have other buildings/towers that still survive to this day that are tourist attractions . to think they built something that has survived this long in time is a testament to their greatness . they began to record events record time their own history and developed a calendar so accurate that our modern calendar is considered by some to be inferior to it . they were unlocking cosmic events and recording history or weather patterns in order to properly predict when they will happen again . that is pretty incredible . the incas are a very unique civilization in that they accomplished and created wonders without the wheel without a written language and without currency . take the machu picchu complex for example just go google pictures of that place and realize they built it on a freakin mountain top . oh and do you like potatoes bro . yeah . well you better thank the incas because that s where the potato we all know and love came from . the incas cultivated and harvested the potato to feed their empire . and if that is n't impressive enough the incas also successfully performed successful surgery on human skulls and the patients lived to boot and created a way to farm on mountain terrain . they also recorded their own history and had a system for sharing knowledge without using a alphabet nor writing as we all know today . the aztecs were another civilization that had a terribly late start as far as civilization goes . they had basically the scraps of territory left over to work with . but that did n't keep our aztec friends down . no sir they were short on farm land and invented a interesting little thing called floating gardens . yes they are as cool as they sound . you see being short on space means you have to get creative so they basically just staked twigs reeds and branches together up above say a lake or some body of water . they would then pad it down with mud decaying plants and for the final touch neatly trimmed willow trees were used as anchors to basically keep the structure firmly in place as the tree grew basically the trees border the floating garden . so you think they d stop with just solving their territory and food problem . honey you do n't know aztecs . they went on to use human manure in order to both fertilize the crops and keep the city clean now that s efficient . the aztecs also had universal education and what they taught and had access to is something we do n't even have in the united states yet . they learned trades fisher farmer crafts like pottery and etc architecture math painting military and history . nobility had better classes to be certain though . with school they solved a truancy problem that we still struggle with in the united states . they basically had elders escort the children to school so they actually attended . we could learn a lot education wise from the aztecs ca n't we . did you know the color red was introduced in dye form to the european world by the aztecs . until spaniards first brought it over the best europe had was a lame pale red that did n't have enough pop to it . when the aztec red hit the market it quickly became a staple in the spanish economy for 300 years . british officers and cardinal priests used aztec red while the common soldier wore the lame ass pale red . it was pricey and the people who were able to afford it loved it . the history of these people are amazing and every tribe even the small ones have such a deep culture and amazing story it is a shame that they were nearly eradicated but their ancestors live on today . you may look at a person who speaks spanish and consider that person inferior and ignorant but they are descendants of people who came here first . people who not only thrived in these lands but invented things we still use today without all the modern tools we now enjoy . when was the last time someone built machu pichu . or a pyramid by hand . and yet these people did it . some did it without writing down directions having a written language or using the wheel . not only that but they had civilizations who were remarkably clean with little to no pollution . nearly every single tribe had free healthcare . which may have been their downfall as disease ridden europeans arrived and laid waste to them biological warfare style . european cities were festering grounds for disease and filth which the native people were not accustomed to since they do not shit where they live . you compare our best to their worst and wonder what the hell is wrong with them . my friend you hate them because you simply do not understand them . without them you would not exist nor would this world you enjoy so much for if everything was so perfect in europe why did they leave . oh and did you know that thing in the united states about impeaching a ruler was something europeans copied from the indigenous people . many of things you can find in the constitution were ways of governing that the native people had used and we basically said hey that s pretty nifty . let s copy their homework .

Jae_Siever	cj64wx9	1406171682	. to save you the trouble of reading the entire article this is just another made up flat tax model that shifts even more of the wealthy s historically all time low tax responsibility to everyone else . it s difficult to follow but if you know where to look the true intentions come out . for example the transaction tax would completely replace capital gains taxes estate taxes . 99.8 of all estates today owe nothing in taxes but that 2 has had the estate tax on the verge of death . get it . political pun . there would be no more audits**-yeah of course those cheating the system for years are going to be behind this . i m sure murders are against homicide investigations too . the transaction tax is not just a small tax its also a flat tax . yeah it s exactly the flat tax just in a prettier font . basically i have two problems with flat tax which has never been addressed for good reason flat tax is a scam . 1 the very wealthy do not spend money the way the poor-middle class-less wealthy i.e under 10million dollars do . they can without effort avoid paying anything altogether . and if you need proof of this just look at the current state of the super wealthy not paying taxes . what you expect me to believe they ll go legit all of a sudden . 2 show the people you re pitching this to some results and initiative by making all those tax cheats pay now to prove you have the stones . of course they wo n't because that s who pays them to peddle the snake oil . also how much did you have to pay someone to come up with this crap . i d demand a refund you got robbed .
Jae_Siever	cjknicf	1407517269	. really . can you elaborate on the process and cost associated . i m not entirely clear on the matter but i do recall reading how outdated the treatment plants are and that they ca n't accurately treat fracking water waste . although it would n't surprise me if somewhere they were able to at least recycle it to use again . it would make more sense for the companies to treat the water themselves and re-use it instead of pawning it off on the tax payers . which state . and as far as third parties they are responsible they should know how sensitive people are to the issue right now . i realize most people want the pipe line or fracking i personally want neither but i understand why people want both or one . but i also understand that some of the chemicals associated with both are pretty dangerous and toxic . when you have chemical that could leave water un-drinkable for hundreds of years i m really hesitant to trust the word of a person without the science backing it up .
Jae_Siever	cji0919	1407281060	. that illegal immigrant still had to pay income tax sales tax and property taxes probably more than that . and they most likely did it in cash while never receiving a single dime of that money back . as they ll never be able to claim social security . if they worked in this country they supported local economies and gave the country a college educated graduate who identifies as american and will continue to pay taxes inside our country while again never claiming any of it back . go after businesses that evade taxes and out-source work instead of pablo because pablo is the only person in the world who wants to vacation in america more than anywhere else in the world and is the only person in the world that wants to buy made in america products regardless of what they cost . that s why every jose or jesus you see drives an american car . and yet you consider them un-american . that kid in the video probably knows more about american history than you do .
Jae_Siever	cjxvzuf	1408747925	. good questions i too am interested if any redditor knows the answers . perhaps topic 1 is related to the actual business being fined since no individual was fined directly . does that mean a taxi driver trucker or any sort of delivery person could also deduct any ticket or fine in relation to them driving .
Jae_Siever	cixsnla	1405403264	. . it s very brief but basically the cartels can operate very differently from each other . when you start to look at individual cartels you can see more interesting things for example . u.s authorities and police in laval quebec where cournoyer once lived supposedly dismantled a network specializing in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana hydroponically harvested in british columbia . this is the high grade marijuana from canada that everyone raves about . this is the sinaloa cartel and it s leader <SPECIAL> <SPECIAL> loera or el chapo for short . is/was considered the most powerful drug trafficker in the world by the united states department of the treasury . so far they ve found the sinaloa cartel operating in mexico canada the united states various parts of the middle east and spain . but so far they mainly sell to the united states the other countries are either places they send their own family for example they send their children to boarding school in spain and they may buy equipment from the middle east . here is a smuggling route . you ll have to scroll down to see some better images but it ll give you an idea of how large the demand for illegal drugs in the u.s must be to support it . that is one cartel who is capable of pulling off a worldwide organization . what makes them more dangerous though is how much support they can pull from the local population . these are the sort of guys that will build you a school pay for your roads and even buy you a car as long as you learn how to keep your mouth shut when the authorities roll around . they re also the sort that will kidnap an entire group of people for construction purposes and then murder them so they never have a chance to talk to the authorities .
Jae_Siever	cj86k3x	1406357098	. they wo n't suffer as much as everyone else will . before a single member of the elite dies of thirst millions upon millions will have perished in a horrific manner . if the elite do one thing well it s covering their own collective asses . they could easily buy up the remaining sources of drinking water and create a monopoly . i m a practical sort of person i think we should n't allow toxic chemicals to be dumped into our fresh water supply . now bare with me i realize this is a radical concept . undisclosed chemicals which may render that water undrinkable for hundreds of years may not be in our best interest . especially if said company who spilled it gets to leave the tax payers with the bill or clean up . but that s just me you can drink from that river all you want . but i ll pass and push for change .
Jae_Siever	ci9phs6	1403002423	. unfortunately not enough jobs exist to support everyone who currently works and lives off of minimum wage . and if they suddenly did all migrate they would immediately de-value and dilute the demand . in that scenario suddenly a middle management gig is basically still a minimum wage job . be realistic friend not everyone can be a lawyer or rock star and to claim otherwise is socially dishonest . in our current state the united states government is forced to intervene and provides a form of corporate welfare . i do not believe my tax dollars should go to mc donalds or walmart employees when both mc donalds and walmart can afford to pay their own employees more money . otherwise what s the point . they socialize the loss and privatize the profit . that does n't sound very fair or sustainable to me even if you have a good paying job you should be out-raged that someone is using you so obviously and outlandishly .
Jae_Siever	cj709k8	1406248876	. well the heads of the epa were elected by george w bush so really the epa is run by people who do n't mind if the epa is poorly run . you yourself would probably agree its a poorly run government agency and so do i . our reasons may differ but bottom line is its whack yo . now what liberal and al gore have to do with global warming debates is pretty weak overall . why even bring them up . the environment is n't a political debate . personally i feel that reducing the amount of pollution that goes into the air and water is the fiscally responsible thing to do for two very simple reasons . better air and water quality lead to lower healthcare costs no politics behind this this is why we all do n't just scoop up water from sewers to drink . and reason number two is also water related . it costs tax payer money to run our water treatment plants . if someone wants to contaminate our water sources they sure as hell had better start paying a lot more to keep them clean otherwise they can stop exploiting our resources . the thing with global warming is whether it is true or false the solutions to reducing it actually have benefits aside the warming/cooling of our planet . we ll save more money and have healthier people .
Jae_Siever	cilbshy	1404176294	. you are very correct obama has his flaws and faults some of which i happily point to and say we can do better . but we find ourselves in a bit of a pickle while the obama administration has it s problems most sane people know it could be much much worse under another george w bush administration or a mitt romney . the healthcare bill for example is a massive give away to the insurance industry and is basically nothing more than de-regulation in that sector . it will serve a purpose of course but again we could do better . as much as conservatives hate obama he is basically doing everything they want and more . if it were n't for the racial issue and his name he would be the new ronald reagan in their eyes .
Jae_Siever	cj81thw	1406343269	. the super elite basically live in a way that no matter how bad things get they will be better off than everyone else . so yes ruining the planet is n't that much of a concern as they can afford what little resources/clean drinking water/territory that remains while everyone else dies off . as long as somewhere someone is suffering more than they are this will not change . sociopaths do remarkably well in business .
Jae_Siever	cji0gzv	1407281545	. yeah i hate when noble republican politicians come out demonizing homosexual unions and then get caught accidentally posting nudes of themselves on gay dating sites or get caught with a male prostitute . it s like come on ca n't a conservative suck a cock without getting judged for his hatred of other people .
Jae_Siever	cj9jy7w	1406506472	. if you have time could you clarify on a few matters . 1 most of the elite wealthy not just the top 1 but the top 1 do not earn income . how would they actually contribute anything . if it s a fixed of income and they simply do not earn income would n't a flat tax basically realistically lower their already low tax burden even further . 2 they may pay that much in taxes overall but they also earn nearly 84 of all income in the u.s and income is n't even how most of the country s elite earns their wealth most are born into wealth . so while they do pay taxes they also get most of it back . 3 does the current system not already benefit the wealthy . why should anyone believe that the millionaires and billionaires sponsoring the flat tax proposal are doing this in order to pay more in taxes . it does n't add up quite frankly . 4 agreed on military spending are we not capable of lowering military spending first before we give the wealthy another tax break . this is a lot like gun control in my opinion . before we can seek more strict gun control we should first lower and reduce the reasons people seek to own a firearm be it police corruption crime or general societal insecurity . as we are fully capable now of lowering pork let s first do that to earn trust instead of asking the people to spot you another 20 because you ll totally pay us back next week . all and all i find it socially dishonest to claim every person in american can own a business or have a good idea . not everyone can be rich you re basically asking for communism which is ironic . not only is it socially dishonest but it also diminishes the accomplishments of people who have been successful . and on another note not everyone strives to be a billionaire or seeks to trample other people underneath their boot . life liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
Jae_Siever	cjvkpq6	1408547031	. purposely assaulting maiming or killing federal law enforcement animals such as police dogs and horses could be fined at least 1,000 and spend up to 10 years in prison . as far as police killing civilian pets the law is n't as punishing . the law considers your family dog property so if a leo law enforcement officer were to shoot the dog it would be as serious as them shooting your coffee table .
Jae_Siever	cia9biq	1403047890	. the irish in the united states dating back to 1890 until 1920 perhaps even longer was treated brutally by the local populations . many of your kin were beaten murdered and down right despised by the americans already living here . many of the miners who first began unionizing were irish-american . entire families were murdered in attempts to disrupt and destroy those early unions . to see you here hating mexicans the same way other people hated your family is saddening . your irish family has done well that s lovely . i m willing to wager somewhere one mexican family has also done well . you just have a lot of blind hatred and have fallen deep for the immigrant propaganda that your own family was subjected to . i encourage you to look it up and see what fresh off the boat irish immigrants had to endure and how similar it is to mexicans . the only real difference is many of those mexicans people were already here generations prior . i mean texas was a part of mexico before it was a part of the united states and the people who stayed became americans . and yet you might see them landscaping in your state and suddenly believe them to be the illegals . odds are they re been here a lot longer than you have friend .
Jae_Siever	cj7b5tw	1406280047	. minimum wage jobs are n't the sort of work people are most concerned about losing . i agree entirely that a fry cook or fast food worker is not at much risk for a very long time . people like the human element and ultimately leaving a few human workers will be cost effective in addition to machines that increase their productivity . what is at serious risk are pilots truckers drivers of all sorts delivery cab etc . self-driving software and systems are not a thing of the future as they already exist and are improving rapidly . a pilot is considered a skilled sort of profession and they are at risk of being almost entirely replaced within the next 5 years . while someone like a stewardess will not be at risk of being replaced even though her position is n't considered as a high skill sort . another problem with software and advancements in computer a.i is the human element could also become obsolete as far as programming goes . the human mind could not compete with a.i and self improvements would come quickly . we d have farm workers miners waiters and most of the low paying jobs still around and a lot of new people working for them . that is not sustainable . we ve waited to act until our houses are on fire since the bush administration and then we spend the entire time being told to wait for the trickle down to make it all worth while . well it s been 12 years and i have n't felt so much as a drizzle . but no let s just keep doing what we re doing because the job market has been such a fairy-tale . it s not like it s terrible right now or anything .
Jae_Siever	cjk5w9t	1407466049	. gas prices have gone up over the years even with subsidies and tax breaks . they will continue to rise and fall regardless of taxes more things are taken into consideration aside taxes . namely what the consumer is willing to pay for it . they already maximize profit they are n't a charity . if you think they are n't already passing on as much as they possibly can to the consumer and other industries then you sir should not seek a profession in the business world . they are working every moment every day every idea/angle to create more profit . welcome to 30 years ago .
Jae_Siever	cin3kyv	1404346089	. as bad as that was it s nice to see some attempted change . a ipad overall is still probably slightly cheaper than the mountain of books some kids use..unfortunately the books tend to last longer and no one really tries to steal them . they should just go with e-readers you can find some decent enough ones for 25 dollars . some slightly average ones run 40 and the knock your socks off brands are 100-300 .
Jae_Siever	cia94cx	1403047461	. your first two sentences are entirely false on multiple fronts to begin with the difference between 7 and 10 is a mere 3 dollars an hour per employee . 100 dollars is a 93 dollar difference per employee . this is a very simple thing to see is n't it . 93 is larger than 3 93 dollars can buy you 93 dollar burgers with no tax and 3 dollars can only buy you 3 . you ca n't simply increase the number a massive amount without first considering the impact . 3 dollars is a trickle whereas 100 is an ocean as stated above . by your logic we could decrease the minimum wage to one penny an hour and save the economy . because everyone can have a job . what no . oh right because even if everyone cost a cent they would not hire more than they have to . even high skilled individuals are earning low wages and some are working for the minimum already how do you explain this if the minimum wage has not even been increased in many of the effected areas . so you will very soon and already do have skilled workers earning minimum wage . you are n't even paying for it so i do n't know why you re fighting it so far . you would pay less if minimum wage went up as no evidence exists that shows any correlation involving minimum wage and inflation . because you know inflation has existed and occurred while the minimum wage was 5 . and i m willing to wager if we just leave it at 7.25 the cost of living will continue to increase anyway . right now things are pretty bad are they not . why are we going to continue down the current bush era path that got us into this mess in the first place . it s time to try something new and coddling the largest firms and the most wealthy individuals has not worked . they pay less taxes and earn more but none of that has trickled down and now we see evidence that it actually has had a negative impact on the economy . otherwise again please point and show me where our progress is hiding . again they were cutting hours ages before the affordable care act even went into effect . they were out-sourcing work when factory workers made a mere 5 dollars an hour . i do n't see any threat here as it already happened and is happening . you re basically telling me the sky is going to fall and i m here to tell you it fell a long time ago we re trying to pick up the pieces and do something different . employers have very little strain unions have been gutted and union membership is down . actual corporate tax rates in the u.s are among the lowest in the country and overall profits are at an all time high . we have fortune 500 companies who do n't pay a single cent in taxes and some others even get more money from the government in addition to paying nothing in taxes . it s the small mom and pop shops that are suffering right now and none of your solutions would ever reach them or benefit them . they wo n't benefit from any of it because they do n't have the resources available to them to use all the lovely corporate tax loop holes . nor do they have an army of lobbyists to buy our politicians . they will suffer moreso than they already do now and that is pretty grim . to sum up what you want is simple . you want less government but more government you ll do everything to fix the country and it wo n't cost a penny . never mind the details voodoo economics works and we should trust you . we do n't need all that math history or examples of other countries we all just need a copy of atlas shrugged . also the affordable care act is basically a libertarians wet dream . it was written by the healthcare industry and in reality is nothing but a removal of regulations on the healthcare industry . i do n't think i ve ever seen such a massive give away to one industry . obama is a conservative politician that is defended by liberals and hated by conservatives . the roles should be reversed but hopefully for me within a few years i ll be a citizen of canada and wo n't ever have to deal with this insanity that is u.s politics again .
Jae_Siever	ciaa8sx	1403050032	. the houses are normally fire damaged or have some sort of additional fees associated to them . property taxes are basically what they want you to pay for that s why they offer them up for a dollar . i ve heard those rumors too and in addition to those rumors some of the houses have already been hit and torn apart for said pipes or wiring . you d be buying the obligation to pay property taxes for a dollar basically .
Jae_Siever	ci9pub4	1403004221	. high skill jobs are currently low paying too . if everyone developed a skill it would n't really be much of a skill now would it . we have very skilled people who have run the numbers and found that all it would take to cover the differences is a price increase of 3 to 20 cents on appetizers and entrees at restaurants . that applies to the restaurant industry at least . but it gets better . your way of thinking is deeply flawed because they are n't exactly lowering prices with how badly the u.s wages have stagnated and decreased . they tend to price things at what the consumer is willing to pay regardless of what the consumer earns . if i charge you ten dollars for a bottle of imported water you bet your sweet bippy i m not going to suddenly drop my price just because i pay the person who sells my product 1 penny an hour . i m going to charge what you are willing to pay for it . the price of fuel has a larger impact on small and large businesses than the minimum wage going up by a god damn dollar does . and you re a fool if you do n't realize that .
Jae_Siever	cjvkpq6	1408547031	. purposely assaulting maiming or killing federal law enforcement animals such as police dogs and horses could be fined at least 1,000 and spend up to 10 years in prison . as far as police killing civilian pets the law is n't as punishing . the law considers your family dog property so if a leo law enforcement officer were to shoot the dog it would be as serious as them shooting your coffee table .
Jae_Siever	cj8or5f	1406415485	. let me sum up my stance . all of them r liars polluting is bad and the people who spilled it should have to pay for clean up make sure it never happens again pay extra because the local water treatment plants are going to have to waste a ton of resources someone should be jailed and i agree the epa is pretty useless but we have to realize it s run by people bush appointed . obama s appointees are being held up and delayed by the house . why yes obama is almost as bad as bush and the reasons i use are more valid than the made up stories of fancy that the tea party types use .
Jae_Siever	ciu5jl2	1405048301	. history is a great tool so that is a pretty safe estimate then . we had vietnam as an example the gulf war black hawk down..probably a lot of cold war era things and our occupation of germany to go on . while none of them were our occupation of iraq it gives enough of a example to draw a conclusion from . for example people do n't tend to like it when someone from another country comes in and tells them what to do . and not knowing the difference between those people and their religious views is even more of a reason to avoid the region . very few things in history has motivated people like religion when it comes to war . i agree the military is pretty professional aside from the rape scandals but the military is n't in charge of spending . even if the military were to demand they stop buying useless things like tanks they do n't need the corruption cycle between private corporation and politicians will make sure they get more . so you are correct there too . a pretty bad situation to be in overall for everyone .
Jae_Siever	cjf2onc	1407007130	. delauro who has been pushing a soda tax since 2012 seems like it s just one politician who has a problem with sugary drinks . overall bad idea just end those damned subsidies . it ll never pass . coffee and energy drinks would be included you do n't fuck with people s coffee in this country .
Jae_Siever	cixsnla	1405403264	. . it s very brief but basically the cartels can operate very differently from each other . when you start to look at individual cartels you can see more interesting things for example . u.s authorities and police in laval quebec where cournoyer once lived supposedly dismantled a network specializing in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana hydroponically harvested in british columbia . this is the high grade marijuana from canada that everyone raves about . this is the sinaloa cartel and it s leader <SPECIAL> <SPECIAL> loera or el chapo for short . is/was considered the most powerful drug trafficker in the world by the united states department of the treasury . so far they ve found the sinaloa cartel operating in mexico canada the united states various parts of the middle east and spain . but so far they mainly sell to the united states the other countries are either places they send their own family for example they send their children to boarding school in spain and they may buy equipment from the middle east . here is a smuggling route . you ll have to scroll down to see some better images but it ll give you an idea of how large the demand for illegal drugs in the u.s must be to support it . that is one cartel who is capable of pulling off a worldwide organization . what makes them more dangerous though is how much support they can pull from the local population . these are the sort of guys that will build you a school pay for your roads and even buy you a car as long as you learn how to keep your mouth shut when the authorities roll around . they re also the sort that will kidnap an entire group of people for construction purposes and then murder them so they never have a chance to talk to the authorities .
Jae_Siever	cj9jy7w	1406506472	. if you have time could you clarify on a few matters . 1 most of the elite wealthy not just the top 1 but the top 1 do not earn income . how would they actually contribute anything . if it s a fixed of income and they simply do not earn income would n't a flat tax basically realistically lower their already low tax burden even further . 2 they may pay that much in taxes overall but they also earn nearly 84 of all income in the u.s and income is n't even how most of the country s elite earns their wealth most are born into wealth . so while they do pay taxes they also get most of it back . 3 does the current system not already benefit the wealthy . why should anyone believe that the millionaires and billionaires sponsoring the flat tax proposal are doing this in order to pay more in taxes . it does n't add up quite frankly . 4 agreed on military spending are we not capable of lowering military spending first before we give the wealthy another tax break . this is a lot like gun control in my opinion . before we can seek more strict gun control we should first lower and reduce the reasons people seek to own a firearm be it police corruption crime or general societal insecurity . as we are fully capable now of lowering pork let s first do that to earn trust instead of asking the people to spot you another 20 because you ll totally pay us back next week . all and all i find it socially dishonest to claim every person in american can own a business or have a good idea . not everyone can be rich you re basically asking for communism which is ironic . not only is it socially dishonest but it also diminishes the accomplishments of people who have been successful . and on another note not everyone strives to be a billionaire or seeks to trample other people underneath their boot . life liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
Jae_Siever	cj7ay2z	1406278925	. i agree we should start by kicking all those immigrants out . let s start with english french and spanish settlers who first came over to the new world . why did they leave the white wonderland . it was full of wealth and equality . by the way if that was n't obvious enough please remember that immigrants have been getting the blame in the united states for over a hundred years . the exact same propaganda you re spewing was used against eastern europeans . have n't you ever seen gangs of new york . history is an amazing subject you should start by looking into the living conditions of irish immigrants in the late 1800s and early 1900s . you ll find the exact crap said about them that people are using on hispanics today . crazy right . quite a simple tactic create a scapegoat and have all the poor attack each other for table scraps . and you you little pawn you are selling out for free . you re accepting a pat on the head instead of actual scraps . how many years did it take them to house break you . i just hope you can keep that hatred to yourself instead of limiting any children you may have . because that sort of ignorance will hurt them in the future while you re hate will be rotting in the ground where it belongs .
Jae_Siever	cjk5w9t	1407466049	. gas prices have gone up over the years even with subsidies and tax breaks . they will continue to rise and fall regardless of taxes more things are taken into consideration aside taxes . namely what the consumer is willing to pay for it . they already maximize profit they are n't a charity . if you think they are n't already passing on as much as they possibly can to the consumer and other industries then you sir should not seek a profession in the business world . they are working every moment every day every idea/angle to create more profit . welcome to 30 years ago .
Jae_Siever	ciu5615	1405047522	. i ve seen a lot of both parties are bad posts but this is the only one that gets to the truth of the issue without all the fanfare . all the faults of the republican party are well documented and most of the complaints about the obama administration are so far-fetched it alienates otherwise rationale people from seeing the faults of obama and in general cowardly democratic politicians . if people used those issues against obama at debates and attacked him for that then they d have a foot to stand on . but they wo n't instead it s benghazi and obama being a communislamist .
Jae_Siever	cj86k3x	1406357098	. they wo n't suffer as much as everyone else will . before a single member of the elite dies of thirst millions upon millions will have perished in a horrific manner . if the elite do one thing well it s covering their own collective asses . they could easily buy up the remaining sources of drinking water and create a monopoly . i m a practical sort of person i think we should n't allow toxic chemicals to be dumped into our fresh water supply . now bare with me i realize this is a radical concept . undisclosed chemicals which may render that water undrinkable for hundreds of years may not be in our best interest . especially if said company who spilled it gets to leave the tax payers with the bill or clean up . but that s just me you can drink from that river all you want . but i ll pass and push for change .
Jae_Siever	ci9pdeq	1403001738	. in some parts of the united states living conditions are equivalent to third world countries . we actually have relief workers that normally operate in third world countries coming over to united states and providing assistance and medical care such as remote area medical . . not trying to put you down or offend you since i used to think that way too . but if you take the time and actually look you ll discover that the third world extends to our own country . we as a society simply ignore them and have done so for many years . be honest with yourself have you ever gone looking for poverty or do you sometimes stumble upon on it in your day to day life . i m willing to wager the few times you may have come close to true poverty you did not linger in it s presence . that and what s up with everyone not vaccinating their kids anymore in the u.s and canada .
Jae_Siever	cji0046	1407280519	. parts of the united states like texas belonged to mexico and quite a few mexicans stayed in their land when the united states took over . you know what was n't california a part of mexico once too . man i wonder what sort of country the u.s would be if two of the largest contributors to the union texas and california were not a part of said union . i think we also had a native american sort of people that lived here once upon a time . i think they have a sports team named after them . i might be wrong but . did those native americans ever issue you a green card .
Jae_Siever	cjfw61o	1407094271	. they still use them as workers even in prison and we have more people imprisoned than any other country . you pick strange things to be upset about . sadly the majority of gangs and the worst types are american maybe a cartel operates here and there like selling high grade marijuana to new york but they use the hell s angels to deliver it . it s a strange thing . as much as we blame illegal immigrants they re the only group of people on the planet that buy american products . it s like every mexican i ve ever met wants an american truck but every american i meet either want an italian car or drives a japanese car .
Jae_Siever	ciu5615	1405047522	. i ve seen a lot of both parties are bad posts but this is the only one that gets to the truth of the issue without all the fanfare . all the faults of the republican party are well documented and most of the complaints about the obama administration are so far-fetched it alienates otherwise rationale people from seeing the faults of obama and in general cowardly democratic politicians . if people used those issues against obama at debates and attacked him for that then they d have a foot to stand on . but they wo n't instead it s benghazi and obama being a communislamist .
Jae_Siever	cjfwppn	1407095521	. depends on the restaurant . in canada they have something called tim hortons which is like the u.s s dunkin donuts . tim horton s has a lot of demand for cheap labor . they need them to basically make stuff still and last i checked they do use touch screens in some locations also overcomes language barrier . but they still need people to cook the actual product .
Jae_Siever	ciaa5se	1403049835	. i live in il currently and have looked at property both to rent and buy . your claims are a little dishonest and you are n't factoring in many things . to begin with the type of house you ll find for that price will be horribly maintained and of the lowest quality in addition to either being in a awful high crime area to being in the middle of nowhere . it is basically a shack and not even a nice shack at that . you d be better off buying yourself a sleeping bag and digging a hole to use as a bathroom you ll save more money and can do it while living on minimum wage . the system works . but in all seriousness that house you listed will be a massive money sink and will not increase in value . on top of that it will cost more than 200 a month to live there . your friend or you are either lying or leaving something very important out . i saw a chart a while ago about how many hours a minimum wage worker has to work to afford a two bedroom unit and here s the link incase you were wondering . . that s double 1 hour for good measure over the 40 hour a week work week most will get .
Jae_Siever	cit5oam	1404959884	. it sort of reminds me of japan and germany s wwii battleships the bismarck and yamato . both were cutting edge battleships with massive price tags attached . much like everyone is so sure we need multi trillion dollar airplanes they were so sure that both of these battleships would rule the oceans for years to come . bismarck was immobilized by small cheap and out-dated destroyers in comparison to itself . and then sunk by two-three torpedoes . the yamato was sunk by eleven torpedoes and a few bombs . in a similar situation if the u.s ever did get into a modern war that relied on airsupport our overpriced airforce could probably be overtaken by a fleet of cheaper aged aircraft . or our airforce could be caught grounded and completely annihilated before it lifted off .
Jae_Siever	cj64wx9	1406171682	. to save you the trouble of reading the entire article this is just another made up flat tax model that shifts even more of the wealthy s historically all time low tax responsibility to everyone else . it s difficult to follow but if you know where to look the true intentions come out . for example the transaction tax would completely replace capital gains taxes estate taxes . 99.8 of all estates today owe nothing in taxes but that 2 has had the estate tax on the verge of death . get it . political pun . there would be no more audits**-yeah of course those cheating the system for years are going to be behind this . i m sure murders are against homicide investigations too . the transaction tax is not just a small tax its also a flat tax . yeah it s exactly the flat tax just in a prettier font . basically i have two problems with flat tax which has never been addressed for good reason flat tax is a scam . 1 the very wealthy do not spend money the way the poor-middle class-less wealthy i.e under 10million dollars do . they can without effort avoid paying anything altogether . and if you need proof of this just look at the current state of the super wealthy not paying taxes . what you expect me to believe they ll go legit all of a sudden . 2 show the people you re pitching this to some results and initiative by making all those tax cheats pay now to prove you have the stones . of course they wo n't because that s who pays them to peddle the snake oil . also how much did you have to pay someone to come up with this crap . i d demand a refund you got robbed .
Darktidemage	citfbf6	1404993954	. and it s 100 obsolete due to unmanned fighters . a human body can only take so many g-forces . you need a seat . a windshield to see out of . you ca n't react to something in 1 milliseconds . you ca n't read radar feed directly to your brain . your plane also does n't have a rocket engine on it that can fire when you get in a dog fight . you ca n't cruise through airspace at mach 20 and fire your missile payload at the right moment . that we are still even working on planes humans fly is pretty funny .
Darktidemage	ceipe9z	1389021339	. the real immoral part is why it s remaining illegal which is people who want to retain their power influence and income . cops lawyers judges politicians prison owners alcohol producers they all are intentionally doing wrong in order to line their own pockets . they do n't care if the drug is illegal as long as their funding goes up as long as they get the same number of cases or sell the same number of beers or get the same amount of campaign donations . it s the lobbying against common sense and right just because the outcome may negatively impact you . that is the plague of immorality that is ripping this country apart .
Darktidemage	cftd9r5	1393870936	. yes she is guilty of not proper gun usage if you define the times you can use a gun as only when you are in fear of your life . it s still not attempted murder . which is what i said . and i do n't define proper gun usage like that . i can see all types of uses for them when you are n't fearing for your life like to start a race hunting marksmanship and warning shots .
Darktidemage	cikus6w	1404140907	. pretty sure the i do n't want illegal drug cartels getting billions is worth mentioning too . also i think it s a bad idea for 1000s in cash to be transferred between private citizens with zero accountability security or legal recourse in the event or robbery these are definitely valid points worth mentioning in addition to the great personal freedom point you mentioned .
Darktidemage	cen7wvf	1389480351	. i do n't think you are a bible thumping idiot who deserves death just for disagreeing with me . but i do think it when i see evidence of it . and just because not all people who vote repub are like that does n't mean we would n't be better off if we did n't have the lot of them .
Darktidemage	cfu8wl5	1393957428	. can you explain why my point is ignorant . the u.s.a is telling russia not to do something . you claim that something is well known to not be good . so how is it reasonable to tell the u.s.a they are wrong again . clearly they are not wrong . they are correct to be telling russia is this is a bad idea . nothing you said invalidates my point . in fact it all makes my point stronger . you are saying you completely agree with the u.s.a and that russia invading ukraine is fucking awful .
Darktidemage	ckjbdtb	1410820424	. i feel like if you are carrying a rounded off prop sword you should just show it to the cops when they try to stop you not run away from them . they are supposed to be able to identify different sword types prop swords while you are not complying with their orders . when you are running away . you realize when the cops try to stop you and you run away that really indictates it s not a prop sword to them . that indicates it s a real sword . else would n't you be eager to show them and clear it up .
Darktidemage	cjb92y1	1406660658	. you are saying that like this was not the goal . saddam being in power was what we did n't like . we do n't give a shit if extremists are more in control now . they are n't organized . they do n't have all the profits off the oil to funnel into whatever projects they want . they are n't sending shipments of weapons out of the country to influence politics in other spots .
Darktidemage	cfjc5hu	1392830682	. seriously you must be fucking retarded . there are far more people who drink and do n't end up on the 11 o'clock news than people who do no shit . i completely agree . is there some point behind this revelation you decided to share . did you think it was somehow related to my point . because it is n't . do you think because there are more responsible drinkers that means when deaths are reduced it could n't possibly be because we have improved how irresponsible drinkers act . . . because that seems to be what you are saying but it does n't make any fucking sense . if there are 1000 people and 5 of them are irresponsible drinkers and then we educate those 5 people so now later that year there are only 3 irresponsible drinkers this could explain a reduction in driving deaths . agree . so you agree completely with what i said and you have just been spouting off unrelated retarded bullshit . congrats on still being alive after having whatever childhood you must have had it had to have been rough .
Darktidemage	cffhgfl	1392412889	. a realistic view is not complete disdain . members of the military are not saints nor are they particularly good people . some are but on average they are the same as anyone else average people . nor is someone a bad person for not going into the military . it s fucking ridiculous to speak in absolutes like military people are great and non-military people wear fedoras and are wannabe liberals . are you trying to make your point clearly invalid and a joke . if anyone says anything bad about the military they are just trying to be edgy to look cool . now let s spend another few trillion and flush our future down the toilet based on this theory . go military go .
Darktidemage	cgt2m39	1397577436	. it s because of the electoral college . i live in new york city . the guy i want to win is going to win here . why should i waste my time casting a literally valueless vote . yes it pisses me off that my vote does n't count for shit . it should be changed . the national majority should choose who wins . my vote should be worth an equal amount as someone in ohio . if i want the democrat and they want the republican then my vote should be weighed against their vote . instead my vote is just not counted . at all . their vote counts mine does n't .
Darktidemage	ckarm71	1410014740	. in court when the cops say we lost the file i do n't get how that is not strong reason to dismiss the case and free the person . is it that hard to not lose a file . it s a persons life you are dealing with here . locking them in prison for 30 years . and guess what if losing the file they go free the file will magically never be lost because they only lose it when they know it s damaging to keeping the guy behind bars .
Darktidemage	cihjo6r	1403788922	. head slappingly simple not when you consider what will happen when 15 dollar minimum wage kicks in . if you do n't think prices are going to go up you are dumb . i make 70k a year now . when minimum wage goes from 8 dollars to 15 dollars per hour you do n't think i m going to go negotiate a raise of my own . do n't you think everyone that has a job is going to . imagine you get 30k a year salary and the guy at mcdonalds is making 20k or whatever . now suddenly he gets a raise to making 35k a year you think i m not either getting a raise too or quitting . what kind of bitch do you think i am . so everyone is getting raises if minimum wage doubles . everyone that is not a complete spineless moron . say i run my own project i work my ass off to produce some goods and i sell them . i make a little bit over minimum wage . now they raise minimum wage to 15 dollars per hour now i make under minimum wage . my incentive is now to stop working my project and work a minimum wage job instead or raise my prices . raising minimum wage may actually have no effect on purchasing power at all . i know it s head slappingly simple when you think the only effect will be more money for those people and nothing else will change .
Darktidemage	cikw709	1404144023	. why not . they take innocent people who have some substance and in some cases lock them up for life . or at the best case scenario give them a criminal record so they wind up poor and have horrible job prospects . it s also primarily race based . they lock up black kids at like 3x the rate of white kids even though the rate of drug use is the same . you think the war on drugs is n't that big of a deal morally . why not compare it to slavery . you re just really fucking awful . the war on drugs is the worst moral crime of the modern world . the question is extreme relevant when discussing do we have an obligation to go into backward states and force them to adopt more progressive ideologies . i believe we do have that obligation with the war on drugs as we did with slavery . we ca n't just say they will handle it those states have demonstrated in the past they are morally bankrupt and ignorant .
Darktidemage	cikujsi	1404140347	. you think having such a high rate of single parenthood does n't impact the black prospective work force of young adults negatively at all . i think it does . i think a large aspect this study attributes to racism in hiring is actually explained by discrepancy in quality of applicants .
Darktidemage	cjd029w	1406816667	. the police department said 36 percent of the tickets were issued to african-americans who make up just eight percent of the city s population . because it s not theoretically plausible that different socioeconomic conditions make it so black smokers tend to smoke in public more often than white smokers .
Darktidemage	cjnfxhp	1407791523	. i m just commenting on the we made it worse theory . how can you tell if you have not seen alternative realities where we did n't get involved . how do you know it s worse than if we had not . saddam did gas attacks on kurds right . so who says our deposing him made the region worse . if he was still there you are sure it would all be sunshine and rainbows . .
Darktidemage	cf3wy9l	1391205048	. the bathroom you reasonably should use is decided by what parts you have not by how you identify yourself . i do n't think all the elementary school age girls are quite ready to share a bathroom with someone that has a cock and balls nor should they be forced to just to make that one person more comfortable . gay male students are still expected to use the boys bathroom because that is fucking reasonable . maybe you are extremely mature and understand sexuality . the 7 year old girl seeing you in her bathroom may not understand it quite so well nor everyone else and you are part of a society not some free floating individual with no responsibility to anyone else . parents probably do n't want their young children possibly seeing genitals of the opposite sex . that s reasonable . your rights do n't magically outweigh all of theirs just because you are trans .
Darktidemage	cfu625h	1393951352	. say i stub my toe really bad . does that make me unqualified to tell someone else to be careful walking through a room in the dark . or does it make me more qualified . and then there is the other argument standing to insist is derived primarily from power which we have .
Darktidemage	cf4gkoy	1391275309	. it has nothing to do with trans women . do trans women not live on the same planet as us . what the fuck would you have done if the man in this article had gone around for a year or two saying i identify as a woman ban him from the locker room . or say well now it s her right to expose her cock to the women in the locker room . lets say you are a woman who was raped by a guy in a bathroom or locker room . can you see how maybe you do n't want penises to be allowed into your locker room . you ca n't see how that might be a legitimate concern . because the world you live in is one where everyone is always honest and there are n't perverts and sex offenders and murderers and rapists right .
Darktidemage	cjvl94q	1408548122	. what do n't you get about what i said . what if when you implemented this and then everyone says ok i do not want to be a cop because it sounds to me like i may be jailed for doing what i think is right in the moment but which looks bad on video what do you do then .
Darktidemage	cgs4ty7	1397489107	. it s tanks helicopters boats planes . these things use oil . we fear a day when our oil suddenly runs out if another country still has a supply they can easily enslave us and force us to live out the rest of our lives in concentration camps .
Darktidemage	cjvliyb	1408548653	. listen right now you have people who want to be cops . they know they wo n't go to jail if they hit someone while speeding without their car lights on and try to arrest that person for dwi or whatever . . . now you are going to change that so they go to jail . that is going to make it so you have a lot less applicants to be cops . the job suddenly seems quite a bit more dangerous . so you are saying i may get hurt and i may also go to jail . like my job right now . i would want the job less if it came with a camera strapped to me and if i miss-step and break the law i go to jail . they would have to pay me a lot more to wear that even if the chance of my going to jail is pretty low . it s just another huge worry . i know it s the right thing to do and it will be good for society but as soon as you tell someone you will be constantly recorded and held accountable for any issues you are going to have to incentives them a shit load more to take on that huge risk .
Darktidemage	cjp1qum	1407939213	. it s like the dark knight . batman escalated things by dressing up theatrically and wearing a mask so the result was the joker rose into existence to challenge him . the police have bomb resistant vehicles now . how long till a citizen decides the most ironic way to protest this is with a road side bomb .
Darktidemage	cjpbz4h	1407958535	. they were educated . does n't that go hand in hand with my point that a smarter enemy is a more dangerous enemy . but wait you are claiming you know who was behind 9-11 . i kinda doubt that you really know that information considering no one does . it was probably someone quite secular . a lot of people speculate it was george w bush amp dick cheney do you think they are particularly religious . i feel like they are faking it . i personally believe it was islamic radical religious extremists . however i am smart and i know one attack which was quite lucky and took advantage of a massive security hole is not indicative that religious vs secular argument is settled . like wow look these religious people did something smart guess that disproves huge general rules about entire segments of the population supported by detailed data . i understand the concept of anecdotes and exceptions . great isis is taking over huge regions . do they yet control an economy the size of pre-war iraq . do they personally get the from selling the state run oil company products . do they funnel that money directly into whatever projects they want . ok so i m not as scared of them as i was of pre-war saddam hussein yet . call me arrogant for not finding disorganized assholes with no real agenda other than spreading their religion particularly scary . i believe this was the plan . it s not like their rise comes as a surprise many suggest we did this on purpose including me . we did do it on purpose because we are n't particularly scared of isis not like we were of saddam .
Darktidemage	cjd029w	1406816667	. the police department said 36 percent of the tickets were issued to african-americans who make up just eight percent of the city s population . because it s not theoretically plausible that different socioeconomic conditions make it so black smokers tend to smoke in public more often than white smokers .

Darktidemage	cfjbptd	1392829789	. any reasonable alcohol drinker there are lots and lots of unreasonable alcohol drinkers . they are who i am talking about . i do n't think any reasonable alcohol drinker has ever died from drinking so nothing you do will affect rates of deaths if you only look at the reasonable drinkers . and there are shit loads of people who draw a sharp distinction between drinking and doing drugs . they drink regularly but look down their nose at anyone that does drugs and consider themselves far better than junkies or druggies . you do n't know anyone like this . i think 90 of drinkers maybe more do n't think of alcohol as a drug .
Darktidemage	cil0630	1404152095	. what an incredibly ignorant point to bring up . would you have to be 18/21 to be hit by a stray bullet fired by a drug dealer who is being pulled over by the police . would you have to be 18/21 to benefit from the better schools due to the tax money . you are acting like the only benefit of legalization applied to smokers . it does n't . we could go back to prohibition of alcohol but we recognized the horrible horrible impact on everyone not just drinkers . the point was if your state is making awful decisions and you are not able to leave because you are a minor or too poor the rest of the country owes you the effort of making your state reform against it s ignorant bitter twisted little will .
Darktidemage	cirs88a	1404843522	. can we get this info broken down by region . i would imagine in the bible belt south areas folks are republican despite being very poor . in nyc republicans are basically just people who vote their wallet instead of their morality . like yes i think it s horrible how the republicans cause massive numbers of abortions with their abstinence only programs and i hate how they are just awful toward women but it will cost me a lot money in taxes if the democrats win so i vote for what i consider evil just to save a buck .
Darktidemage	cgm76gc	1396876260	. <SPECIAL> results speak for <SPECIAL> what were the results of the waterboarding . i thought we got no actionable intelligence from it . is n't that what the investigations into it all find . so yes the results do speak for themselves and they are damning of you mr cheney .
Darktidemage	cftcmfj	1393869577	. if you think your life is in danger shoot to kill . how about if you think someone might be thinking about putting your life in danger but has n't yet and you want to avoid shooting them to death . you think in that case firing a shot in the air is attempting murder .
Darktidemage	citksne	1405007583	. that s a really really telling and ignorant logical fallacy you just used . apparently you ca n't grasp the concept i do n't know details of a classified project but logically it makes a lot of sense that it exists . do you know the details of any classified projects . so you are saying you do n't think there are any classified projects because only things you know the details of exist . and you are also saying you do n't think our government is working on unmanned fighters which is basically as dumb as a bag of hammers .
Darktidemage	ckiy394	1410795812	. so . you act like this is such a damning fact . it is n't . if we did n't lead to isil who says shit would n't be worse . the same fundamentalist fuckers would be living there with the same ideologies but we would n't be bombing them . how would that be better . i d rather we are bombing them . now hopefully in the next 5 years our coalition will destroy isil and the unified western arab force that does it will maybe result in a mid east that can actually function and drag itself out of the middle ages .
Darktidemage	ceipjqw	1389021815	. well that is completely reasonable . the mother is brain dead she is not a consideration anymore so the baby is the only consideration . there is a chance you can save the baby and it will have a normal life just because some random people the mothers parents want you to abort does n't mean shit why the fuck would you do that . the mother is the one who has the right to abort a baby not her parents . it seems a lot more likely that the mother would say if i die try to save my baby rather than if i die just throw my baby away with the bath water . . . . . and even if she had specifically said i want an abortion and was planning on having one now that she is brain dead her opinion does n't mean shit anymore . try to save the baby anyway .
Darktidemage	cepd0t5	1389718107	. i stopped reading at everything is stacked against those who are born black or brown in the title because i already knew the article was complete shit . not everything is stacked against you . you have fucking amazing opportunities and you choose to shit all over them . everything is stacked against kids in slums in india who do n't have clean water or kids in syria who s parents and house just got blown up . and they are probably better at math than you . washington d.c spends a shit ton more money per student than most places and gets horrible results . compare them to montana . it s not the system that is screwing the black kids it s the black kids family that is screwing the black kid . considering the country is less racist now than it was in the 60s and 70s but the average black student does far far worse than they did then . so you ca n't blame the racism you can blame changes in the black parents .
Darktidemage	cn3gtb2	1419359953	. i m calling it now . the police killed those 2 cops in brooklyn . a chinese guy and a hispanic guy both new to the force . yup . they were killed by their own bosses just so the conversation can turn in this direction . 100 . guaranteed .
Darktidemage	ckarnwp	1410014871	. at the very least i would like to see it s your job to keep all these files if any of the files go missing we will treat you like it was your job to watch this big pile of money and some of the money went missing . when a file represents a person being locked behind bars for 30 years the person responsible for it should be responsible for it . not oh it went missing well is n't that odd . it should be it went missing now the guy is freed you are on trial for obstruction of justice .
Darktidemage	ckj6nu4	1410811657	. it s not who s appearance i find threatening jesus christ . someone in public with a weapon who disobeys police orders and runs off . that has nothing to do with appearance . it has to do with him having the means to kill someone on hand and a willingness to disobey the police who are just there trying to figure out what is going on . if you decide to go out in public with a sword or even just a prop that looks like a sword you must understand the consequences of your decision . if cops show up and start giving you orders you have a higher than standard responsibility to follow those orders well . deal with it .
Darktidemage	cjvpoui	1408556413	. if cop a can kill someone and get away with it and cop b is held accountable you are really sitting there saying to my face you ca n't see how cop b faces more risks in the course of his job . again it seems like you are coming at this conversation in a very obtuse fucking way . how it should be and in a perfect world bullshit has no place in this conversation . we are talking about impacts of real decisions in the real actual world . that you can say stupid shit like if you hold them accountable i ca n't see how it makes the job less attractive is really really detrimental . you clearly can see that . if you could n't see and agree with that i d have serious worries about you .
Darktidemage	cf3rqsw	1391194254	. i do n't think transgender people should be allowed to use the opposite sex s bathroom . i could easily see having someone with a penis using the womens room making the women that also have to share it uncomfortable . how do you prove you are really transsexual . how do you prevent abuse if you just tell all men you can use the womens locker room if you want based on nothing but your word . do you have any idea how many scum bags there are out there who would take advantage of this for nefarious purposes . the women who do n't want penises in their bathroom should have the right to not be forced to have them there . their rights to be comfortable matter just as much as the rights of the trans person . it s extremely easy to imagine a male who is not trans deciding to claim they are trans and then use the women s restroom . what prevents this . absolutely nothing so how is it reasonable to tell all the women they just have to deal with this potentially happening . gay men use the men s locker rooms and bathrooms . they do n't go use the womens . why not . because it s not fair to the straight women who expect to only see vaginas in there . it s not what sex you are attracted to that determines which locker room you use it s what physical parts you have . it s not geneder identification it s what physical parts you have . no one is calling you a male they are saying you have male parts so use the fucking male parts designated area . no one can tell you are trans or gay by looking at you unless you go into the fucking womens room then they will know you are trans and you are going to have serious problems when a 14 year old girl goes running out screaming because she sees your cock flopping around and her redneck father takes offense . far far more problems than you are going to have if you just use the mens locker room like every gay guy does .
Darktidemage	cfjiz73	1392843972	. i said i think tokers are mature . no i did n't say that . at all . you ca n't read . you have demonstrated that multiple times in a row back to back . you are fucking dumb . stop talking . do n't interact with other people until you have gone back over this exchange we have just had at least 15 times and can specifically point out to yourself the ways in which your posts were just completely wrong . you have four groups of people . mature drinkers immature drinkers mature smokers immature smokers i think changing marijuana law will help immature drinkers realize what exactly they are doing abusing a drug . that is all i fucking said . you read 50 things that were not said into it because you do n't know how to parse text and figure out what it means aka reading you suck dick at it . go take a reading comprehension class or something . i did n't say marijuana smokers are mature . i did n't say drinkers are all immature . i did n't say any of the shit you apparently think i said . why do you think i said a bunch of stuff i did n't say . what the actual fuck is wrong with you .
Darktidemage	cfbrfd9	1392050408	. religious school . if you choose to work for a religion you should shut the fuck up about that religion acting like it has been acting since day one thousands of years ago . learn about your employer before you dedicate your life to working for them otherwise expect no sympathy .
Darktidemage	cmvxp59	1418682490	. it s also about deterrence . there are definitely a bunch of rich happy arabs out there in the world who will run the other direction if they hear anyone talk about terrorism now because they do n't want to wind up getting fed up their ass they would rather spend the rest of their lives enjoying their . it s also about the guy in the next cell over . sure torturing prisoner a does n't get you good information from prisoner a . but what about prisoner b who you are n't torturing he is just seeing what is happening to prisoner a .
Darktidemage	cf0chgq	1390857673	. unless you realize that the mission of the members of the nsa may be to keep their job power . look at all the information snowden had . say he did n't blow the whistle but instead just leaked the information to corporations like jpmorgan or citigroup or something . how much money could he have gotten . it s more than believable a few rogue members of the nsa would go to any lengths to protect their status . look how much they are violating everyone s privacy despite the fact it s well documented it is not stopping any terrorist attacks . how does that jive with your theory . i think it s safe to say they are off their stated mission at this point and are more being guided by mental illness brought on by having so much unchecked power .
Darktidemage	ceo2dtq	1389573364	. the latest accommodation to their social attitudes came wednesday when new york governor andrew cuomo announced an executive order permitting medical marijuana for seriously ill patients . what . . so literally any change that happens is just appeasing millennials . we are n't actually also having social progress like when civil rights happened and womens rights and stuff . gay rights is just millenial appeasement . this article reads like something an idiot would write .
Darktidemage	cjvlum0	1408549283	. this is like saying the following job a you weld these joints to 10 mm precision and we will pay you 100 job b you weld these joints to 01mm precision and we pay you 100 if you were offered both of these jobs and you took a it means you are an asshole that does n't value quality work or something . if you have two jobs out there unaccountable cop vs accountable cop and they pay the same amount you are going to wind up with a lot less accountable cops signing up . they will be lower quality people because it s a shittier job to have . you have to grasp that . you ca n't just make a job much shittier and then expect nothing to change at all because people value accountability . it s true they do value it and they may be willing to pay extra for it but they wo n't take on the accountability themselves at risk to themselves for nothing .
Darktidemage	cmwzy1n	1418769081	. again is this statement confusing to you that is n't saying the overall effect is to deter . it s saying it does deter some do you think the person whos mom is being tortured is the average . a direct blood relation is clearly going to be affected differently than some random dude who does n't know the person being tortured how is that your example .
Darktidemage	cikrvxs	1404132289	. what if they behave the same ways . because i note black and white males are not the same and random they act differently . it would be interesting to pick two who seem very similar and see how big of a factor their skin color is as opposed to their differences in character .
Darktidemage	cn3aku9	1419348048	. his language and behavior makes it look a lot like it was really the police who carried out the double murder . oh this happened because we were having a conversation about problems in the police motherfucker that just makes it sound like you did this to try to get us to stop protesting and talking about those other murders you did .
ForgettableUsername	cmq3vmc	1418159821	. that s exactly what i m talking about . i m beginning to suspect that you re a bot . every response from you comes from a weird oblique angle that makes it seem like you re just responding to keywords and not actually following my train of thought .
ForgettableUsername	cn8huwx	1419878168	. i think the problem is greatly exagerated . worse than that it s poorly framed . the language people are using suggests that there are tons of racist cops out there who just get up in the morning and decide to go out murdering black people all day and that s all they do and somehow nobody noticed until now . that s not a realistic assessment . if you look into it at all beyond the shallowest level you see that the reason the cops kept hassling garner is because he kept breaking the law not because they were racists . the reason they used force is because he was visibly angry and agitated . you called him a non-violent offender above but that s also not true he had assault in his long arrest record too . it seems to me that the main problem is that the officer used the chokehold his department had banned . that s definitely something he should not have done and he should be disciplined for it . but it hardly comes to the level of the neo-nazi death squads everyone seems to be imagining .
ForgettableUsername	cm9of09	1416640030	. that s a good point . they are n't blood related which means that if hillary becomes president it will be no more an example of nepotism than when augustus caesar became emperor of rome . and i think any right-thinking person will agree that everything was in order on that day .
ForgettableUsername	cgxjimc	1398025937	. they might not mean as much as we might like but they mean more than they do in china . china is a single-party state that actively suppresses opposition parties . we have two major parties so there s at least a one-dimensional spectrum of political choices . the fact that there are two parties mean that elected officials need to be careful about pissing off their constituents too much because a relatively small group of voters switching from one party to the other could be enough to get them voted out of office . this is rarely a consideration in single-party states .
ForgettableUsername	clrjuih	1415000246	. how . if there is deliberate fraud involved it does n't matter if there is paper or not results cand be falsified . if we re only worried about error digital systems have many fewer errors than manually counted paper systems . remember the bush/gore election in 2000 . they counted it manually multiple times and got different results . ultimately pretty much all paper audits are useless because we ca n't or more realistically we should n't rely on the accuracy of human counters . manual counting is less accurate than electronic counting so it should be completely invalid as a check against electronic counting .
ForgettableUsername	cn7vyz3	1419816500	. i ve never designed a schoolbus . it s probably something that i could do if i had the right equipment and information but nobody in their right mind would hire me to design a bus that would carry actual children if i had n't demonstrated some kind of aptitude in a similar field first . the question should n't be can some people be competent jurors some of the time . it needs to be can almost everybody be competent jurors almost every time . and the answer is almost certainly no . being a juror who makes correct decisions the majority of the time almost certainly requires more education and more intelligence than most people have not to mention a longer attention span .

ForgettableUsername	cmzzt2n	1419028854	. and why should we expect them to do that . you ca n't legislate information security . by the time anything got through congress the particulars would be so out of date that they d be useless . even big corporations which are only inhibited by a fraction of the bureaucracy that government officials face ca n't respond quickly or effectively to hacker threats . how the heck is congress supposed to . particularly when they re still throwing around terms and tech concepts from the 1980s . we already know they do n't get net neutrality . it s only been a few years ted stevens described the internet as a series of tubes . he s dead now but orrin hatch is to be the president pro tempore of the senate next year . in 2003 he wanted to make it so copyright holders could remotely destroy computers owned by people who were suspected of copyright infringement . this guy is in no way competent to make technical decisions about information security .

ForgettableUsername	cerrixg	1389944860	. yeah no governor interested in being re-elected would ever do that . there d be way too many opportunities for his opponents to call him soft on crime and way too many people convicted on marijuana crimes who also had long rap sheets besides that all an opposing candidate would have to do is make an ad that goes like this gov . so-and-so wants to free johnny whoever who was able to duck charges of arson burglary and hitting a baby seal due to technicalities . do you want johnny whoever running free in the streets . my wife helen and i sure do n't . that s why we re voting for patrick what's-his-name . tough on crime . tough on leadership . vote what's-his-name .

ForgettableUsername	cl81aaj	1413180720	. by denying the inherent rights of sovereign persons you inexorably subscribe to a system of abuses perpetuate by a state that unjustly pretends that each of its citizens are not separate countries . this is tantamount to universal disenfranchisement . how do you sleep at night . i ve been a sovereign citizen for forty-two years and in all that time i have never been contacted by the european union or the united nations . i set up rooms in my basement to act as foreign embassies but no foreign country besides my neighbor scott has yet accepted my offer for diplomatic relations .
ForgettableUsername	cn7tz34	1419812545	. i have very little faith in a jury of my peers . most people are n't trained to think scientifically or logically and do n't have the background to evaluate whether or not a claim is true . for the most part people make decisions based on the emotional content of an argument not evidence or facts . people will believe a single eye-witness over a documented and reproducible scientific result nearly every time . i think in practice this tends to be mitigated a bit by there being lawyers to present two sides of the argument and by the built-in bias toward in favor of the accused . but it s far from an ideal or even a fair system . whether you win or lose has more to do with the skill of your lawyer than it does with the evidence .

mike8787	cem69vp	1389368803	. i am a lawyer and you are incorrect . conspiracy by its definition requires collusion with n+1 persons where n is the number of people required to commit the crime . for example conspiracy to commit murder would require at least two people as murder can be committed by only one person . alternative conspiracy to gamble would require three people as gambling itself requires two people you ca n't gamble with yourself . prostitution and bigamy are other good examples . there are several more specific elements to conspiracy including agreement to commit all of the elements of an offense . for example conspiracy to commit burglary would require you to agree with another to 1 intent 2 to break 3 and enter 4 the dwelling of another 5 at night 6 to commit a felony . say you and your friend knew that your neighbor left all of his doors open at night and you could sneak in . since you did n't have to break to get in breaking literally means anything from knocking down a wall to pushing open an ajar door there is no conspiracy to commit burglary . aaaaand i know apologize for vomiting out bar exam info at you . i do n't use it in practice so you just got a fistful of unsolicited info .

mike8787	chy5rth	1401814210	. the point is that there is a massive pre-funding requirement that is doing usps no favors and a number of politicians are ignoring this requirement when deeming the usps a failure that needs to be privatized . a problem with the entire thinking on this subject is the belief that usps is supposed to be in the black . usps is one of the few government services that actually brings in some revenue to pay for itself . all other programs are funded by tax payer money and are in essence in the red . usps s purpose is not to be a revenue builder . it is to ensure that all americans no matter where they live and the cost are able to receive mail something the private sector would n't necessarily provide . since their purpose is to provide universal coverage not maximally efficient coverage it is not a failure that usps is in the red . as i said nearly every other government program and service uses tax dollars while not producing revenue . why treat usps as a failure or as being dragged down when reality is expecting it to be fully cost-neutral is unrealistic and that it ever was cost-neutral while providing universal coverage is impressive .

mike8787	cltdf13	1415160933	. you are just making stuff up . the seats at issue were traditionally red/purple states that republicans had held or had an equal shot at outside of louisiana and iowa both of which are still possible democrat holds . the states at issue alaska has been red for years before begich in 08 . kentucky has had a republican in this seat since 1985 . arkansas is a purple state with regular party swaps georgia has been predominately red though could be considered purple north carolina s seat was red back to the 70 s before hagan . colorado s seat was red back to the 70 s until udall . these were the issue seats . they were all red or perhaps purple seats that turned blue in the wave of support for dem s in 2008 . that you argue against this is ridiculous . these are the definition of red areas . this year marks the six year anniversary of the 2008 presidential election when democrats came out en masse and a disproportionate number of senate seats turned blue 21 seats out of 36 . all of those seats are up for election this year but excitement is far from 2008 levels when obama first ran . in turn two years later in 2010 the right had a surge . that year they won a whopping 22 out of 31 seats . all of those seats are up in 2016 . like with those voting democrat in 2008 the tea party anti-obama fervor has lessened . they are unlikely to see a repeat of the 2010 electorate . this election may disfavor the democrats but it is a balancing out . 2016 will be a bad year for the republicans . that you have convinced yourself that this election is some sort of mandate or message and not things returning to normal is just ridiculous .

jg821	cm08rg9	1415783590	. gt we ve been in a class warfare for the past 30 years it s been a lot longer than that . part of reclaiming this debate lies in owning up to the reality that class warfare is the normal state of affairs . do n't you realize that by saying yeah there is class warfare the conservatives started it . you are playing right into their hand . class warfare is still being used as an accusation as a cudgel against those advocating for self-serving economic policies as if that was an aberrational thing . but it is not an aberration that is the norm . we need to jettison this dewy eyed notion that all classes in society can come to see the light and work together on common interests . no the nature of economic life is that there are divergent interests . some people own a mortgage and want low interest rates . some people loan money out and want high interest rates . economic interests even within a single society are not shared across all classes . we should be actively aspiring to class warfare . the next time a conservative accuses you or your side of class warfare you should not reply you started it . instead yes we are in class warfare and our class has all the numbers and is due for a victory . they should be afraid of inciting us to action not taking bemused potshots at us as we deny the facts of the world around us . we should actively aspire to class consciousness . running away from divisive economic issues or painting economics as a game of everybody wins is idiotic . it does not match reality and it does not push people to see their true interests . because the class war is ongoing whether or not we admit it . we have been losing ground since vietnam and part of the reason for this is our own cowardice to call a spade a spade . like it or not the wealthy and powerful only care about the economic fate of the masses in so far as things do n't get bad enough to upset the prevailing order . the goal of mass politics should be to mobilize in order to recapture as much of the social surplus as possible . since wwii productivity and technological progress have gone through the roof . we can make more and better than ever before . and yet we see middle class wages stagnant poverty lingers and americans are working longer hours and taking fewer vacations than ever . hell we now have both men and women in the workplace too . the pie has grown ever larger and the social surplus ever greater and yet we still toil away at the same long hours and for the same sized slice . 50 years ago the leading economists of the day thought we would be working leisurely 25 hour weeks and living a life of affluence and plenty . since that day we have put people on the moon invented ways to communicate near-instantaneously with people across the globe and have devised ways of taking energy directly from the sun . but we have not yet been able to devise a way for average middle class families to live in a true state of economic security . productivity gains were not enough . automation was not enough . the computer and communications revolution and globalization were all not enough . the only way to win economic security for the middle class is to take back our share of the social surplus from those who currently reap what we sow . that necessarily will require class warfare not as a grudging counter measure to fend of the economic vultures but instead as a rallying cry to coalesce the disparate identities that comprise the poor and middle class into a cohesive political force one powerful enough to win some ground back for a change .

jg821	cm6sksb	1416381164	. i guess what i mean to say is that the concept of the sample representing the population means something different to formal statistics than it does to american politics . as in formal statistics would suggest you want something 2,500 in your sample to get really tight confidence bands . if you are accepting of wider bands something around 1,000 would be sufficient for it to be said to represent the population . but when we are speaking about american politics the notion of representation carries a lot more baggage . by a negative example most would not agree that a sample that does not include at least a handful of people from each state is representative of american political opinion . ditto for racial/ethnic educational age and other such variables . the statistics itself is much more agnostic about this presuming that adequate sampling will wash this out and that any extreme cases of demographic/geographic skew are highly unlikely and therefore fall outside the confidence band .

jg821	cm6q09z	1416373393	. i think i commented before you slipped that edit in there so just wanted to voice my agreement with the sentiment . if people and/or legislators are actually concerned about creating american jobs building infrastructure with cascading cost-saving effects across the economy or investing in our future then investments in basic infrastructure are the obvious choice . as you mention so many roads and bridges need work and the construction industry was the hardest hit by the great recession so badly hit that it still has not recovered . the dedication to passing keystone because of jobs and economic benefits is in bad faith . if they honestly wanted to pursue those objectives there are innumerable other infrastructure projects ready and waiting for funding today which would yield higher returns . the only explanation for the focus on keystone is the profits it will generate for a select group of well-connected and politically influential executives . but then we all already knew this .

jg821	cm02qj1	1415764510	. but there is not always a substantive difference between the options . yes someone who thinks that the us is 1/3 muslim when it is only 1 is probably very mislead . but someone who is 10 points off of the correct proportion of christians in this country when both values are clear majorities . i do n't think that is testing anything but trivia .
jg821	ckvp86m	1412011146	. why should n't ceo s make millions because it distorts both political and economic life in profound ways when a class of super-rich emerges in a society . politically it undermines democracy and public faith in the institutions of government . economically these inequalities breed economic stagnation and massive waste of productive resources . market should correct why would the market correct for this . first of all the processes that determine ceo pay are not market driven they are driven by the personal relationships between executives and board members . you think that the board goes shopping around for cheap c-level talent . hardly . second there is substantially less incentive to cost cutting when those bearing the cuts are the same as those making the decision to cut . that is to say when it is the executives and the board making decisions as to where to cut back expenses it is highly unlikely that they choose their own salaries as the place to start . sure there is a world in which the board and the executives of a corporation are antagonistic with each other and seeking to remunerate the other at the lowest level possible for the good of the firm . but there is also an equilibrium strategy for both sides to collude to support each others high pay . given that board members and ceos typically are from the same social class colleges etc it is not surprising that they choose the latter course of action . not an arguments to legislate anything well no of course that part was not an argument that was a statement of a position that was argued later . as for car collection and jay leno well i do n't see how that is relevant to anything .
jg821	cly9s1t	1415611388	. so every once in a while academics and the like will talk about the state as a stationary bandit sort of to illuminate some things about the origins of the state form but also to be somewhat tongue in cheek . but here we have actual state employees with guns and the full force of the law behind them acting like actual highway bandits . it boggles the mind .
jg821	clpjayw	1414791930	. because there was a freak out when they went to start trying gitmo detainees in civilian courts they were going to have a trial in nyc but our islamophobic tic flared up and it became politically toxic . since then the administration has n't touched the issue with a 10 foot pole . this is also partly why obama is so trigger happy with the drones . if you have a mandate to kill or capture a suspected terrorist and capturing them means sending them to gitmo legal limbo and political backlash it is preferable to just kill them . gross but there ya go .
jg821	cmqhqcx	1418185539	. with modern communications technology it makes very little sense for everyone to rush into urban centers at the same time and all leave at the same time . in a more rationally organized society we would be staggering things like commutes and holidays so as to not overburden our underfunded transportation infrastructure .
jg821	cl0l2lg	1412467005	. the cold war was largely resolved by the new thinking of mikhail gorbachev he changed the way that the soviet state understood its security interests in the eastern theater and his unilateral moves toward accommodation and rapprochement with the us which were initially rebuffed eventually convinced us leaders to de-escalate the conflict . this is all more notable because state collapse is rarely peaceful especially colonial/imperialist states like the ussr was in eastern europe . the fall of the ussr could have resulted in a bloody war in europe as the soviet ruling class struggled to hang on to their former subject states . it did not the transition was remarkably peaceful to the surprise of pretty much every expert commenting on the issue in the west . as for the statement that the palestinian people are a threat to israel well i do n't condone your eliminationist logic and think that you should reflect on how that premise necessitates the conflict continuing and precludes peaceful or cooperative solutions at the outset . israel was created because of the threat of the palestinian people this statement is completely false and totally at odds with all history on the subject . israel was created out of the zionist movement birthed around the turn of 1900 galvanized by the horrors of the holocaust and made possible due to local complexities caused by the somewhat forced retreat of european colonial powers from the region .
jg821	cleuhh5	1413832527	. and the worst part it was all according to the plans of the isis leadership . they intended desired even for those tapes to be broadcast far and wide in the hopes that it would rouse the american military giant and impel it to act . the media to the surprise of no one shouts of the brutality from the rooftops and demands that something must be done and that american politicians much take a stand regardless of the strategic considerations surrounding another nation-building project in iraq . and like some great unthinking beast the american military rose from its slumber and lashed out against isis just as they had planned it from the outset . i generally do not like it when the actions of the american government follow exactly the plan laid out by radical religious zealots across the world . we should be neither this predictable nor this quick to get involved in military conflicts without an exit strategy .
jg821	cmaj52w	1416735003	. also bush sr was a cia man insider himself and bush jr inherited basically his whole team . as for reagan he gave them so much leeway and plenty of fun missions to go on i m sure they loved him because his foreign policy gave them a prominent role as well as a wide berth . i think the real question which i do n't know the answer to was how genuinely anti-communist carter was . from what i know of other administrations it is strong anti-communism that is usually associated with ready use of the cia for interventions and the like . see reagan on one side of things iran contra and jfk on the other bay of pigs early vietnam .
jg821	cloj9en	1414702223	. midterms campaigns are not aiming at convincing voters disgusted with the system to vote they are aimed at getting turnout from members of the base . when you go from a voter to a non-voter the only way that the major parties know to appeal to you is via your demographics precisely the politics as usual that protest voters are trying to end . how will your protest of not voting be registered by the powers that be . how will they discern that you did not vote because you think the system is rigged rather than just because of tuesday night bingo .
jg821	clqn9m3	1414913829	. our influence on energy policy internationally is as strong as our global leadership on the issue . that is to say we have very little to speak of . our greatest reduction in fossil fuel consumption in the past generation was not out of any sea change in energy policy or major initiative but instead an unintentional consequence of our economic malaise . now china and india not only are they consumers of many of the same technologies that we develop but they also use our economic strength as their standard of the first world . if we want to convince these nations to contribute less to the problem we need to make a credible commitment to do the same . these nations will insist that their citizens be allowed to live the same scale of lifestyle as us citizens with the same carbon footprint . if this is going to be possible we need to lower the carbon cost that comes with that aspiration . all this means focusing here at home . it is the same approach that you voiced above being so hasty to point the finger at other countries as the source of the issue that prevents the us from having any influence on this specific issue internationally . while nations like germany and china are actively exploring wind and solar energy as major elements in their national grid s we are exploring new ways to frack and turn rocks into oil-slush . if the us was your leader on energy policy you would be headed up to the tar-sands of canada right now waiting for the keystone pipeline to get built to give you a quick ride home . edit also if you want to have the ear of china and india you need to talk about things in per capita terms otherwise they will write off the comparison .
jg821	clqj5ns	1414900224	. because i am not advocating for head start . i am addressing your charge that hs is a policy where liberal politicians fail to acknowledge that the weight of the evidence directly contradicts their understanding of the benefits of the program a charge which i do not believe you have adequately substantiated . my argument should you desire to read and understand it is afaict still posted above .
jg821	clv1ky0	1415306727	. so it does n't matter who knowingly made the bad loans because they were able to gloss over their rotten core and push them off onto the balance books of someone else . are you really that committed to the notion that it was all government s fault that you are willing to swallow this sort of logic . as for your other points you ever hear of aig . or were you too busy railing against government regulations to pay attention to what actually was happening . a blog post by reason magazine is hardly evidence especially when the source material of that blog post places the onus of the blame squarely on the behavior of the banks the ones doing the lending if you doubt this read the nber paper rather than trusting reason s ideological framing . not that expect anything to get through to you i can already see the way that you rationalize away uncomfortable facts upthread .
jg821	clbouvg	1413510659	. can you give a denominator to those figures . if the conversation is about billionaires i do n't see why a large sum of money raised from small time donors should be included in these figures without comment . just giving plain sums of the money distorts the facts of the matter . if all 1 billion to one part were from 1 guy whereas the other party raised 2 billion but from equivalent donations from 2 million separate donors which party is more tied to monied interests .
jg821	cmdvzis	1417036091	. less protection from local justice department who very often rely on amicable relations with the police for the rest of their work and therefore have very strong dis-incentives to actively pursue wrongful death or police brutality cases with any gusto . putting civilian-police disputes in the hands of an independent agency would go a long way to cutting down on these perverse incentives .
jg821	cmebs7a	1417074427	. that he would n't shoot after he already shot him . please . do you always take the word of cops at face value . one witness out of 11 . i do n't understand why you are so uncritically accepting the exculpatory story of a cop . but i guess have faith in the authorities they have our best interests at heart .
jg821	cl7ygnq	1413172371	. celebratory gunfire is wholly distinct from warning shots . it is a different phenomenon . celebratory gunfire is significantly more likely to be 1 in the air rather than at the ground 2 emptying the clip/etc rather than a single or short burst of fire 3 wild and indiscriminate 4 associated with alcohol/drug use for all of these reasons we should expect it to be far more dangerous than a warning shot . your link is not relevant to this discussion . regarding the police i am saying that the police have no incentive to use warning shots because they face little sanction when using lethal force . civilians are in a different legal situation and therefore will behave differently . the question of whether or not it is more dangerous does not play into it . police frequently break down doors in drug raids despite this being proven to be significantly more dangerous in practice not to mention wholly unnecessary because time is not of the essence in a drug raid as it is with a crime underway . police tactics do not always follow what is most safe .
jg821	clqe640	1414888661	. i mean i guess that could qualify as fiscally conservative as the category is inherently ambiguous but everyone i know who believes in spending on social welfare but not the military will identify their politics in a much different fashion . as to ron paul s economics end the fed and the like they can not be considered conservative by any reasonable definition of the term . ending the federal reserve and putting the us economy on the track to the gold standard are very radical propositions . reactionary yes but not at all conservative .
jg821	cmljy5j	1417743718	. that forbes link says nothing about the profit margin of oil producers . it is talking about the profit margin of franchise gas station owners . these are very different things . i ca n't stand to read that other link you posted as the author is so caught up with insulting people that it is hard to figure out what he is trying to say . where are you getting that number from .
jg821	clxaw1g	1415517363	. not in the slightest . the libertarian socialist just generalizes the libertarian argument against coercion to the relations of capitalist production which in their view imply the soft-coercion of work for my wages or starve on the street . this is the political stance of noam chomsky a fairly prominent leftist author you may have heard of . it is not mine .
jg821	cly3wqu	1415592489	. i have not read the entirety of the leaked documents and neither have you . i would hesitate to say anything definitive about that massive trove of information . have you even watched that video . if you had there is no way you could be insisting they thought they were firing at combatants . no one fired on the soldiers in the copter once in the ten minute or so engagement .
jg821	cmdyvln	1417041826	. i thought we were talking about in general . and you know this is a loaded question entirely dependent on one s understanding of the specific course of events that transpired that day . given that the reality will never be known or even properly ascertained in a court of law i am not going to presume to know what happened and nor should you or anyone else here .
jg821	clojrbu	1414703168	. because it is impossible to determine the positive content of a negative result . you can not discern by looking at non-response rates what those non-responders would have preferred to vote for absent further study . you ca n't determine the ratio of 1 non-voters who chose not to vote due to dislike of the current system to 2 non-voters who chose not to vote out of apathy/lack of opportunity . if the whole point of not voting is to protest the current system you need to identify a mechanism by which a particular non-vote can be determined to have been not cast out of protest . i noted above one way that has been attempted but also noted that it was extremely difficult to get the system to register that protest vote/non-vote and it took so much time and effort from the poll workers that doing en masse would prevent the polling location from serving all its voters in time something which itself would not break the system as it is already the status quo in many districts today . because in his district casting a blank ballot was/is not possible with the way the ballots are set up and therefore he had to discuss his option with the poll workers and design an ad hoc way of casting an empty ballot which reportedly took somewhere between 30 and 45 minutes . my suspicion above was one he himself voice . but continue pretending that you know much more about what happened in this case than the person who was actually there .
jg821	clqe640	1414888661	. i mean i guess that could qualify as fiscally conservative as the category is inherently ambiguous but everyone i know who believes in spending on social welfare but not the military will identify their politics in a much different fashion . as to ron paul s economics end the fed and the like they can not be considered conservative by any reasonable definition of the term . ending the federal reserve and putting the us economy on the track to the gold standard are very radical propositions . reactionary yes but not at all conservative .
jg821	cmf7ipq	1417172381	. you need to brush up on your math . you have shifted from absolute to relative figures . there is a difference . there is also a difference between committing a crime and being convicted of it . especially in the context of a judicial system that is overwhelmingly biases against african americans and much more likely to convict them compared to white peers .
jg821	cl9ee60	1413313323	. yeah the president s own economic advisers were advocating for 1.2 trillion in stimulus but did not think that it was politically feasible . if you were at all following the public debate when larry summers name was floated for next fed chair you would have heard a lot about this critics of summers blame him for advocating for a smaller stimulus than the calculations were recommending contending that it was his job to be an economic adviser not a political one and that he should have been primarily concerned with the best policy from an economic perspective not a political one . you can read about it here .
jg821	cmaggkq	1416723846	. the political maneuver that changed nixon s electoral fortunes around the notorious southern strategy . i would not champion him as some pioneer in racial justice . added to this is the fact that nixon began a new re-vamped phase of the war on drugs which as i am sure you are aware has been extremely damaging for african-american communities across the country . nixon s major stance in the election that he won was playing up concerns over law and order also engaging in a bit of the old states rights rhetoric . these were classic racial dog whistles especially in the late 60 s when black americans were mobilizing on the streets to demand greater equality . edit nixon was a gamesman he supported integration out of political calculation to not alienate relevant interests who supported it in other parts of the country . you leave out of your comment any mention of the role of the courts or the legislature during this time both were pushing integration as well . not enforcing court orders or vetoing legislation coming out of congress with a bi-partisan backing would have reflected very poorly on him and undercut his authority . knowing which way the wind blows and bending accordingly does not mean you have a moral compass .
jg821	clxz2k4	1415583013	. gt obama basically erroneously stated low gas prices means the us economy is on the brink of collapse . so by obama s own judgement the drop in gas prices looks bad for the us economy . this is not at all an accurate characterization of what he said there . like very obviously and very clearly wrong . reading comprehension is important . work on yours .
