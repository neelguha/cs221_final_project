jjandre	ci6omvo	1402678832	. that 800 billion line is a lie of omission . the joint tax committee estimated that replacing the alternative minimum tax with the buffet rule would add 793 billion to the deficit . republicans argue that the buffet rule will only raise 50 5 billion in revenue a year and therefore would not improve the deficit by much . none of that applies here . the buffet rule is n't being enacted to reduce the deficit . it s being used in this case to pay for the college loan refinancing program making it deficit neutral . that is a good thing since republicans demand that any new spending program be deficit neutral . this one is . and since the atm is n't being replaced it will not add 793 billion to the deficit . in this case it will reduce the deficit in the long term because it adds money to the pockets of the middle class . also the bill achieves its budget neutrality by curtailing tax loopholes that the rich have carved out for themselves over the years . it sets their effective tax rates to be more in line with the effective rates that the middle class pays . it is fair and smart lawmaking . the only ones complaining about it are the ones gaming the tax system paying extremely low effective rates . they designed the system to be gamed . that s how millionaires paying 11 rates is even possible . they have the most money therefore the most influence with republicans . this perfectly illustrates the fact that republicans in congress look out for the interests of the rich over the rest of us .	2.000000,31.000000,12.000000,10.847225,0.073684,5.652489,

jjandre	cijtnhe	1404016511	. a smarter man than me once asked me what common knowledge was . i offered my answer and was rebutted with an illustration of common knowledge being the things that we know but have forgotten when we learned them . his point being what s considered common knowledge to one person may be information that another has yet to learn with our perception of the concept being flawed . my point is this many people have an equally ill informed attitude about success . in their mind hard work bootstraps working smart setting up your life the right way infallibly leads to success . it s not exclusively an american way of thinking but it is pervasive here among the successful . supposedly those ingredients never fail because the recipe worked for them forming the basis for their common knowledge of success . they honestly believe that because they have been able to work the system having a path and the resources to do so their experience directly applies to anyone and everyone . it s obvious to those who have n't had the experiences and the help that way of thinking is asinine . it s an elitist and classist view that is devoid of empathy and actual consideration of the experiences of the other lesser classes . telling us to just get a better job or just start our own business or just get more education just pull a little harder on those bootstraps seems simple to the simpleton who suggests it . but that person really does n't have to weigh the consequences decisions does n't have to balance the risks vs rewards does n't have to weigh all the negative financial factors that people who are n't well set do . they do n't have to actually think when they say those things . to them the way out of struggle is common knowledge because they have n't really dealt with the actual struggle of not having money . they have never experienced hunger or had to search for change on the sidewalk for a bus . they have n't been without a car or several meals in a row or a checking account or without electricity or running water or medical care or daycare or without a place to sleep . they have n't had a christmas without presents or opened a birthday gift wrapped in newspaper . they certainly have n't pissed outside in the winter because the toilet bowl water was frozen or had to catch a snake/raccoon/possum in the house because it made its way through the paper thin walls . they do n't know about utilities getting cut off or overdraft fees late payment fees or reconnect fees or extra deposits because of bad credit or cash up front for all the basic necessities or higher interest rates because of low income . they do n't understand that all the good jobs are far far away from poor neighborhoods we have limited options to get to them and we have one hand tied behind our backs when we interview for them . the same goes for all the good schools for our kids . all the things that are devastating to us are minor inconveniences to them . they do n't know that gas and food costs more in bad neighborhoods and that everywhere we turn someone is nickel and dimeing us to the poorhouse . they do n't understand why we do n't have several hundered dollars to form an llc . several hundered dollars is nothing in their minds . their experience has become common knowledge leading them to believe that success is not complicated requiring only wits hard work and applying what you already know . along with all that money you should have saved . they are always short on the specifics as to how to succeed . one can suppose the specifics much like their non applicable generic advice are also common knowledge . everyone has a few grand in spending cash right . use that to go to school or start your business . also be sure to work a little harder and save up some more . living paycheck to paycheck is a foreign concept and being on welfare is really far out there in their world . they do n't realize that 50 million americans are under the poverty line . half of our workers earn less than 30,000 a year . 150 million of us living in households like that . half of our society half of our men women and children getting fed and housed and clothed and educated on a pittance and having what little we earn shaved away from us in every direction . all so we can maintain some basic standard of living . you get what you pay for seems to apply heavily to bankers and ceos industrialists and executives but for society in general the minimal will do . what kind of society are we purchasing exactly . none of this is on their minds because they do n't ever have to see the results in person . they do n't even have to conceptualize it . probably would n't acknowledge even it if they saw it firsthand . we have all heard the analogy of the privileged being born on third base believing they hit a triple . i can honestly tell you that in the case of the bootstrap cheerleaders that analogy is way off . it s more like one of the players asking why we are n't on the field while we re standing outside the stadium hoping to find a scalper charging exrta for sold out nosebleed seats . we did n't grow up playing the game did n't get a free ride to school to get better at it did n't get accepted into the pros and called up to the big leagues . we never had those opportunities available to us . we just showed up at the game hoping to experience a tiny piece of it . turns out we have to pay more than everyone else and get the worst piece . a privileged few are living the american dream while most of us are living the american reality . and those in the middle cling to the status quo because they just do n't want to end up in the bottom portion with us even though they re rapidly headed there . most of us do n't know how to work the financial system . most of us do n't know how to use tax shelters . most of us do n't know how to use our connections to wedge ourselves into lucrative jobs . most of us do n't know how to secure government contracts how to finance a career in politics or how to exploit labor laws . we do n't know how to secure business financing do n't have the 20 capital to qualify for business loans do n't know how to navigate the paperwork for starting businesses . in their minds the money is easy to get and the rest is just common knowledge . i think it s best illustrated parabolically by a quote i heard years ago . i forget whom to arrtibute this to so maybe someone on here can help me out . the quote regards a comic book writer and a comic book illustrator . the

Amaturus	cegmbvs	1388786837	. i sincerely doubt you re actually interested in my answer . you ve accused me of fallacies and nitpicked my statements to an inane degree but i will answer you . at the center of this discussion is the question of whether qe causes inequality . that argument contends that qe raises asset prices mostly owned by the rich and thereby exacerbates inequality . but what is the mechanism by which qe does this . as your most recent link and my paper point out it s called the portfolio-rebalancing effect . the idea is that the government buys up assets and thus forces market actors to choose new investments . because financial assets are not perfectly substitutable it is supposed to have ripple effects in the broader economy motivating investment in higher risk assets than government bonds which includes stock . note that this effect is not because banks are being fed cash or taking profits from reserves as some of your links have tried to argue . those arguments do n't have grounding in academic economics . that s the theory but the first central bank to put the theory into practice was the bank of japan in 2001 when they began purchasing trillions of yen worth of long term government debt . but the expected stimulus never materialized . the nikkei index lost as much as 40 in years after . why was the japanese situation so different that what we ve seen more recently in the us and the uk . my paper answers that . although the intention is there qe can certainly fail to engender the portfolio-rebalancing effect because the financial institutions in the economy have weak capital positions . the paper s empirical findings is that japanese financial instruction failed rebalance their portfolios due to business-cycle risk . assets that were pro-cyclical like stocks were avoided while the banks tried to substitute government bonds with high quality corporate bonds . the paper posits that the boj should have complemented the long-term bond purchases with policies designed to strengthen the capital position of financial institutions such as buying asset-backed securities . so why did qe succeed in the us and uk . because the central banks did strengthen banks capital positions by buying asset-backed securities . that s why mbs purchases are utterly essential for qe to produce the asset value increases you claim cause inequality . looking at the uk article in your last report it gives an extreme caveat . without qe the recession would have been deeper . unemployment higher . capital markets lower . while there s a focus right now on inequality do n't be quick to argue that qe was bad policy .	8.000000,62.000000,21.000000,12.430195,0.081140,6.122493,
